1,Is it possible to switch between conda and virtualenv? That is I want to switch the actual environment managers not just environments in them … I typically use conda but want to try something out that requires virtual env and is not compatible with conda.  Thanks.
1,"What is it that ""requires virtualenv"", most things I know don't require anything other than an interpreter and dependencies"
1,<@Beula> zappa …. at least if you don’t want to mess with the zappa-conda fork.
1,i don’t see why you couldn’t use a virtualenv for virtualenv things and conda for conda things. the issue is when you try to mix them together but as long as you’re pointed at the right python interpreter things should work.; what have you tried so far?
1,Ok. So … I’m not sure how to ‘point’ it at the right thing … not even sure where to start.; Just switch the path/env settings?
1,with virtualenv you activate the environment and it does a lot of handy little things for you like setting the python python.; so you activate the virtualenv when you want to use zappa.; `source /venv-name/bin/activate` should do it; are you using python 2 or python 3?
1,"Conda does the same really, so ```conda create envname``` gives you a conda environment; and then ```source activate envname``` sets it up; you can use ```which python``` to check which one you are using"
1,"but i think the issue is with the library <@Hillary>, :re <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1497625527626658>"
1,3 … and (maybe this is just a dumb question) but I was worried that installing using conda to install virtual env is not what I wanted.
1,"but as <@Johana> said, probably best to not try and mix them up; Oh, hadn't seen zappa before"
1,when you do `which python` what comes up?
1,Normally the conda one.
1,"that’s where we would run into our first issue. we wouldn’t want to be using the conda one. we would want something like the system python, i believe."
1,Right… thus my question :slightly_smiling_face:; Seems like I need to be able to deactivate conda and ‘activate’ python3 (sytem would be python2) and then use virtual env.  Thanks for getting me started on the right track.
1,"when you create the environment, you can specify something like: ``` virtualenv envname --python='path/to/python'```; if that helps"
1,"Yes, thanks <@Hillary>"
1,then follow <@Johana> advice on activating
1,conda sets the path to point to its bin directory … so I may need a way to not do that when trying to do virtualenv/zapp stuff … before I can activate the zappa env (if I understand this correctly).
1,related to this? <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/167>
1,Yes. I just wanted to explore Zappa without having any conda/virtualenv issues. Don’t need conda for this so wanted to switch to using virtualenv and wasn’t sure how to do it. I think I have a strategy now.  Thanks everyone.
2,heya
2,sup <@Rona>; how’s the masters program going?
2,oh I am done
2,nice!
2,graduate a month ago
2,congrats!
2,so now I got time for python meetups; thansk <@Johana>
2,haha.. cool :thumbsup:
2,anything on your end
2,same old stuff for the most part. i’m just trying to achieve perfect work/life ~balance~ harmony. lol
2,me to; I am like 75% coding; if not 10 % of no coding is spent thinking of coding; the rest is sleep; and some netlfix; 75% of coding is doing work coding
2,that’s good.
2,I should say 50% coding 15 % work none coding
2,python or .net?
2,.net; but some python also
2,or both
2,I just love both
2,you try some iron python?
2,I want to
2,you doing C# or VB?
2,I want to try WPF in iron python; even if I have no need; powershell and c#
2,cool
2,vb hell no
2,lol; i agree there. i tried to do iron python LONG time ago. i was a dba but the dev was a C# guy and he was said to have been the best in the university. the university was doing consolidation at the system level so he applied to work at our little lab basically to hide.; i tried to take the opportunity to learn what i could but he ended up not being able to do much coding.
2,anyone who uses macs; this is good <https://monodraw.helftone.com/>; oh wow
2,haha that’s interesting.

4,:open_mouth:; Wait a second.; So you *were* snooping on our private conversation? :flushed:
4,I don't know what conversation but I can make <@Alesia> say what I want
4,"Oh, alright. So you can't see our convo?; Alright.; Not that I say anything bad."
4,"if <@Alesia> is in a channel (public or private) we could snoop with the logs. In private messages <@Alesia> doesn't see them, only when you use `/` commands"

5,hey guys
5,hey buddy
5,"I have installed a python package with pip, made some changes on the source code, recompiled it with `python -m compileall .` but when I run package_name -arguments my changes weren't applied; any tips?"
5,compileall?
5,yeah I did this at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mypackage`
5,oh
5,"I also removed the previous .pyc file; before recompiling; apologies if I'm asking in the wrong channel, I didn't find one for pip issues"
5,"help is a good channel to ask in n/w.; did you install your package with `-e`?; `pip install -e ""path/to/package""`"
5,<@Johana> no; just `pip install mypackage`
5,that would be your issue; -e allows it to be editable; it creates symlinks to where your package exists to the site-packages dir so that you can edit the files and see the changes.
5,hmm; so I need to reinstall it
5,you can install it again on top (i think).; but it’s probably safer to uninstall first
5,"okay; `mypackage should either be a path to a local project or a VCS url beginning with svn+, git+, hg+, or bzr+`"
5,is it local?
5,no
5,"hmmm.. this package is on pypi?; you’re going to want a local copy of whatever package this is. if you are editing it and expecting to see the changes.; for example lets say this is my project dir.

```
|--- requests
|--- my_awesome_app
```; these are two python packages. requests has been cloned down from github but i would like to edit it separately and see the changes in `my_awesome_app`; i would go into the `my_awesome_app` dir and activate the virtualenv.; then type `pip install -e ""../requests""`"
5,virtualenv?; uuuh let me see if I can figure something out by cloning the repo
5,"yes, a virtualenv is short for “virtual environment” it basically makes a copy of your python binaries and places them in a separate location (again using symlinks). This separate location acts as an isolated environment in which you install dependencies/packages. What you gain from this is the ability to only have the packages and package versions you need for that particular project.; if you are using python3 it comes with virtualenv capabillity"
5,does `pip install` look for any particular file?
5,pip install will be looking for a `setup.py` file in the root of the package.
5,great; I think I got this
5,":thumbsup:; it takes a bit to get used to. virtualenvs, pip, and so forth but once you get the process down it will be second nature.; and once you start working with multiple projects with different requirements/dependencies and even python versions you’ll see why this extra stuff exists."
5,hey it worked!
5,the important thing is to try and start using these practices early on so that they become habit as they are typically used by python developers.
5,it actually really works!; this is going to be my first pull request; thank you so much <@Johana>
5,that’s fantastic. i’m glad i could help.
6,Does anyone have a pro tip for freeing up disk space on a SSD?
6,links
6,`rm -rf /`
7,"BleachBit; and ZFS; (compression is freeing space, right?)"
7,"Depends on what OS, but on mac there is a diskutility thing that is used to erase free space, I have seen that reclaim a bit. Also cleaning up a docker cache, if you use docker"
8,I want to use setattr inside a class’s init method. Should I use it on `self` or `self.__dict__` ?
9,"Hey guys for my django web app I'm trying to figure out why my page went from working to a page not found error. It's saying:

Using the URLconf defined in EMC_site.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order: $queue_system/ $admin/ The empty path didn't match any of these. You're seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page.
but it WAS JUST WORKING. I didn't change any code just came home from school. I found that the interpreter was no longer set to python 3.6, it wasn't set to anything so I'm wondering if other things may have changed? Thanks for any help! I'm hoping it is a commonly known problem if something is just working and then starts to give you this error if you come one and off wifi or something. Another one of my projects happens to be having the same problem. I also tried typing /admin or /queue_system after the web address too. Neither worked."

9,<@Natividad> are you running it in a virtual env?
10,Can you edit an active/open excel doc in python?
10,"whats the use case?; you could, but changes wouldn't be replicated; and trying to keep changes in sync between the excel program and the python program would be a headache; so, I'd say this is something that you could do in theory, but I'd not bother"
10,"Yea, I have a client who wants to add rows to a work sheet as he makes selections and I assume he'd like the worksheet open to see the changes. I told him I could just do it in vba but he'd rather have a separate:face_with_rolling_eyes: program apparently.; How would I go about it, if he insists?; I thought you'd run into the same issue as having a workbook open by two different people at the same time"
10,"<@Staci>, I think it’s possible with A LOT of work. I don’t know if there are libraries in Python that actually allow you to open and edit without saving a new version. You can copy an existing workbook, make changes and save that one over the old one."
10,google docs :slightly_smiling_face:
10,"<@Meg>, my thoughts exactly"
10,or office 365; those already have collaboration built into them; why re-invent the wheel; and end up handing the client a 10K bill for development time
10,"haha; <@Staci>, if you’re still keen ~to~ on trying, the best library i’ve seen so far for pretty formatting/excel writing is <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>"
10,"Actually, I remember pywin32 can do stuff with Excel documents.; And bonus: you *can* access already opened documents; But that's crazy of course."
10,"Yea, I've worked with excel before, but never on an open document."
10,<@Staci> I have done something similar by feeding the worksheet live data and cells update automatically as new data comes in. But I used excel dev tools. I dont think one can edit an open excel sheet otherwise.
10,yeah the only real live option is to write some awful VBA glue in the excel to speak to something external via python; it's my eternal hope that they at least put in some sort of c# or powershell automation into excel at some point but I've been hoping for like 10 years now :(
11,"hi folks, i got trouble while trying pandas, how to slice a dataframe using  Int64Index?
I’m search an index base on value ```id = df.loc[df['time'] ==1496587067]``` Then I got an `Index` object `id`, I want to get 10 elms before that index. Which way I should go?"
10,"<@Winnifred> not exactly.  xlsxwriter is only for creating and writing to excel files.  It can't open and read from existing files; right there at the top of the FAQ <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/faq.html>; &gt;&gt;&gt;Can XlsxWriter use an existing Excel file as a template?
No.

XlsxWriter is designed only as a file writer. It cannot read or modify an existing Excel file."
12,how do I get an elastic IP to my ec2 instance? the instance is already running and when I click on it’s description. It’s empty
13,"before a user account can be created in my app it checks whether someone with the same username exists, and then whether someone with the same email has already registered, as both of these are supposed to be unique. Do I really need to check these individually? I know the insert query will fail if the values aren't unique since the columns are set to `unique`, but is there a way to know _which_ one caused the error, so that for example I can tell the user whether their username is taken or whether their email address is already registered."
13,<@Thomasina> your DB will throw an Integrity error with the name of the field in the message. So you can probably parse that one to find out. It could be easier if you are using some ORM but I am not sure.
14,"<@Hermina> Hi. How about this snippet:
```
import pandas as pd

l_num = [num for num in range(10)]

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'num': l_num
}, columns=['num'])

l_id = df.loc[df['num'] == 5]
first_match_id = l_id.index.get_values()[0]
print(df[first_match_id - 5:first_match_id])
```"
15,<@Reda> Just use self
14,"Thanks, I thought there will be a shorter way rather than get the Int index, and slice it with int type :slightly_smiling_face:"
14,Base on your conditional. It may has many matches id. So i think this maybe the shortest way :slightly_smiling_face:.
14,"<@Meg> yep, agreed. I mentioned open and edit wasn’t possible in my first comment (at least with the popular python excel libs)."

17,"Regarding Python Classes. How do we create classes (along with inheritance) to be able to do something like, Class().Function(data).toJSON

So really I'm looking to take the return of Class().Function(data) and pass it to the toJSON property to format the data.

Anyone have an idea?"
17,<@Rolf> did you mean like chaining methods?
17,Yes.; I've looked into @property methods @staticmethods; Just can't figure it out
17,`@staticmethod` just means a function doesn't require an instance of itself to operate on; the key to chaining methods is that you have to return a copy of `self` on chainable methods

27,anyone worked with PyMC?
28,"So, I broke our mysql cluster, how's everyone else's day going?; Apparently a query caused a table to lock and never unlock."
28,"We had that during a deploy once <@Meghan> - someone's console had a lock on a table during a deploy and it got stuck.; You may ask ""why does someone have production access to have a console open"" - but that's beside the point :joy:"

28,"Would be nice to index it, but then those bulk inserts become insert or updates and would likely take a long time."
28,Was the fix pretty difficult today?

28,"Any reason to roll your own test framework? It looks like one big issue is that you don't handle exceptions in the runner, so cleanup won't be guaranteed"

```
with open(path, 'rb') as file_:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: file_.read(4096), b""""):
            hash_obj.update(chunk)
```
Specifically the `b""""`?"
30,"<@Ouida> the docs for `iter` explain it pretty well (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter>).

The second argument is a ""sentinel"" value, which will create the stop condition when the result of the callable (the lambda function) equals that value; So each iteration it will check the result of the lambda against that value, if they're equal it raises `StopIteration`, a special built in exception to exit a loop."
28,"<@Beula> I handle exceptions in the real code, they are included in the ""do some stuff, execute the actual test"" comment. In any event, I thought it made sense to execute the tests this way, and I have a Jenkins job that that does so by executing main.py (each test case being called from within the main file). Really I'm just curious if that goes against any conventions or industry practices because I want to correct any bad habits. I don't really have a reason for rolling my own framework other than to get better at coding (this is my first coding job)."
28,"I'd say that, from experience, don't ever roll your own at work. That's free time stuff until you find a deficiency in community accepted frameworks (unittest or pytest, in the python world for the big couple). Every time I have rolled my own it has bitten me hard.; <@Yessenia> - the `illegal byte sequence` is from stderr of the subprocess, one of the pipes is getting something it can't handle. From the try local it's the `cut -c30`.; If you know you don't want whatever is from that, you can just use `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` and it will be captured (and not printed to the python console). Since from the console you will get bytes back, you'll need to decode and probably strip them"
30,"<@Beula> sure, but what is `b`? it’s not an identifier?"
30,`b''` is a bytes object
30,ohh; okay yeah that makes sense… ha
30,"You have a few of those: `r''` -&gt; raw, `b''` -&gt; bytes, `f''` -&gt; f (format)-string"

37,Is this the right channel to post novice Python questions?
37,Sure
36,"Ok, cool. 
I’m trying to learn more about `super()`

Here’s a code snippet I’ve written:
```
class MyList(list):
    def __len__(self):
        print(""calculating the total number of items in the list"")
        super(MyList, self).__len__()
```
And when I instantiate `MyList` I get the following error:
`TypeError: an integer is required`

what am I doing wrong?"
37,"- `super(MyList, self).__len__()`; + `return super(MyList, self).__len__()`; actually, what Python version are you targeting?; `return super().__len__()` is much nicer :slightly_smiling_face:"
37,Instantiating in Python 3 with that code would be fine I think? But trying to do `x = MyList()` `x.len()` would return `AttributeError: 'MyList' object has no attribute 'len'`
37,I’m using Python 2.7.x
37,"... come to think of it, if you don't do any processing at all, you can just skip this method; if you don't implement it yourself, an original one will be used from `list`"
37,well I’m just practicing with `super`. Let’s say I want to log or print before `__len()__` is executed; ok why do I have to use `return`?
37,You’re saying return the result of my parent classes `len` method.
37,"ok so I did this as well but no return was necessary:
```
class MyDict(dict):
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        print(""adding key: {} and value: {}"".format(key, value))
        super(MyDict, self).__setitem__(key, value)

    def __getattr__(self, key):
        if key not in self:
            return 'key not recognized'
        else:
            return self[key]

```"
37,`setitem` doesn't return anything useful; and there is a return statement in your `getattr` :))
37,ah I see
38,What is the best way to convert a list to a dict? The only thing is I want to specify my keys from outside the list. So the list is basically the values of the dict and I will provide the keys separately.
38,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; values = ['one', 'two', 'three']
&gt;&gt;&gt; keys = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict(zip(keys, values))
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
```"
38,Perfect exactly what I was looking for.

39,"<@Blossom> I think you have a type-o in your question:

```
activate_this = os.path.join( PROJECT_DIR, 'env/shinra/bin', 'activate_this.py'$
```

The `$` is invalid and would cause a syntax error"
39,"oh yeah let me edit that, thanks!"
39,"Otherwise, some questions:

1. Where are you running the `python3 -i ...wsgi.py` command from? The app may not be in your PYTHONPATH
2. Why are you not using  uwsgi or gunicorn to serve the app, vs trying to run it directly?"
39,ive tried running it from both /var/www/shinra/ and var/www/shinra/shinra; I ran it with uwsgi and gunicorn both and was able to get them both to serve the app (without the static files) but I was never able to configure either apache or nginx correctly for my EC2 instance; And the tutorials to configure either of those are old
39,"If you're at all familiar with ansible, here is how I have my recent Django app served from gunicorn ; <https://github.com/mrasband/ansible/blob/master/ottter.yml>"
39,"Oh no idea, but the line exec_start seems to be what I ran when I tried with gunicorn and that worked perfectly so being able to run that as a bash or something would be great; My question there would be, is it ok to run the gunicorn command to start serving the app, store that command to run on server start and just use nginx to feed my static files?; But now that I remember I couldn't do both at the same time, I could only run gunicorn when nginx was stopped and viceversa; I'll do everything again from scratch and see if I manage to work around it now with gunicorn and nginx"
39,"Sounds like you're competing for ports and running into collisions. Nginx should handle 443 and 80, and forward to the ""upstream"" port (if using gunicorn) used by gunicorn (the `-b` flag can set this); With Django it's also pretty much required to use nginx (or another webserver) to serve the static files (created via `./manage.py collectstatic`)"
39,"yeah I thought as much, so I began from scratch and was able to put my app up using `gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 shinra.wsgi`; now, having that, do you have any resource I could use (that could work with either 1.10 or 1.11 and python 3) for setting that up with nginx?; ah.. here is where I got stuck; <https://pastebin.com/r8MrQAPi>; Thats my bash script, I never got it to work haha; Does anyone know how make gunicorn use the python from my virtual environment? for example: `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/python /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi`; running `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi` only works inside my virtual env and not with supervisor; never mind, I got it to work now, my directories were all wrong"

41,<@Meg> so using a simple ajax request using axios or jquery i can post my contents over this API to the database?
41,"and if you're not doing so, use `create-react-app` to get a good project boilerplate with a very high quality webpack configuration; so, what happens is when you wire up `axios` in your react app, it creates a request to the server via GET, PUT, POST, etc; and while you can think of this as similar to jquery's `$.ajax()` method, its a little different"
41,ok
41,have you done anything like this before?
41,"no thats why im kind of confused; ive been able to feed data into my react components; but now posting to the django setup; its not so clear in my mind; im going through the DRF tutorial; dos my axios post request need to point to a view URL that takes in a post, grabs what i send and stores?"
41,"correct; and if you're using DRF, the URL is mapped to at least an `APIView` implementation; which contains a `get(self, request, ...)` or `post(self, request, ...)` implementation"
41,ok; so all that classic jazz if request.GET; etc.
41,out the window

42,<@Mirna> Thanks
41,yeh i would i'll be sending json to the database; thanks for the help though; it confirms im heading in the right direction with DRF
41,"yeah; and what makes things easy is it can handle the serialization/deserialization for you; so you can send in a model representation via json from your client; and it will deserialize it to a model instance which you can do more stuff with; and then sending data back out to the client, it will serialize models to JSON"
41,"ok nice, and just ajax post to the url view which receives the data"
41,"correct; or get, put, etc"

44,"I'm evaluating celery/redis alternatives for task queuing and scheduling. Someone mentioned redislite and apscheduler. Does apscheduler do task queuing or just scheduling? Also, any other alternatives?; This is being used for a Django environment."
44,`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` is good at queuing when you don't need ETA scheduling
44,"So if I'm just firing off a task (not scheduling), that would be a good way to go?; I like that."
44,"Redis-lite would be if you kept celery to make it easier to distribute, otherwise APScheduler could call manage.py commands in your app and be deadsimple"
44,"ah. gotcha.; I was looking at if there was maybe en embedded task queue manager, but I'm not coming up with much. APScheduler looks to be a good route.; Can you fire off tasks immediately without scheduling them using apscheduler?"
44,"Yeah I think the decorator returns the original function. So you could just call it directly iirc; Interesting thought, embedded task queue manager. I think in many cases someone would just use Cron or windows scheduler "

45,"hello everyone, I've requirement where dataset is large like 10 millions records, i want to use django rest framework in order to provide that data.

Question : which one is the best ORM which is efficient for large datasets?

1. Django ORM
2. SQL alchemy

"
45,SQLalchemy is more performant especially if you're using Core.
45,<@Dave> thanks for the suggestion. I've those data on microsoft SQL server.; would like to move to postgresql.
45,"yeah, will be cheaper in the long run; no sql server license :slightly_smiling_face:"
45,<@Romona> <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq/performance.html>
45,how about django ORM? Not good from performance point of view?
45,if you use sqlalchemy you can reflect your mssql database and then create its exact schema in postgres.; and you could use sqlacodegen to create the models.; i've done this very thing to move a .net application to python.
45,"I think ""performance on large data sets"" and ""ORM"" are mutually exclusive. ORMs exist for development convenience, not high performance."
45,"^; and furthermore, you should use pagination and such to actually retrieve the data"
45,"That's not to say you _can't_ get good performance - you can, if you know the ORM well and/or you have access to low level commands like SQLAlchemy Core"
45,Ultimate plan is this only. Move web API .Net to django API.
45,"But they're not designed for that purpose, and will probably impede you somewhat"
45,and there are times you will have to write and execute raw sql
45,sqlalchemy's orm does a pretty good job in general.
45,"It depends a lot on the nature of the querying. If you have good indexing set up and you're only working with a few records at a time, the ORM usually doesn't care if there are 10, 10000, or 1000000 rows in a DB; But if you're doing ""big data"" stuff where you routinely hit large amounts of the table... that's a different matter"
45,reducing joins helps a lot too
45,"yup, ORM joins are often nowhere near as efficient as raw SQL joins"
45,one thing I like about django is you can print out the sql query for a given db access; and then look at it to see if you can improve it
45,SQLAlchemy can do this too!
45,"by django, I mean the django framework, not the ORM; since it is possible to replace the default ORM with sqlalchemy (though I've never done this), but the API is largely the same"
45,"yea, you can mix sqlalchemy and django orm. it's all just python at the end of the day. however, if you swap out one for the other you lose all the benefits of the django orm and how it integrates with the framework."
45,"If performance is a factor than use SQLAlchemy core to work on this large data set. If deadlines are more of a factor that use Django ORM since you're already use DRF. Just make sure to use eager loading on relationships where you can to optimize queries.

52,efficient ways to grab several thousand records/json arrays
52,"u can use python with just requests and json thats what I always use; actually just with requests even; `requests.get('url').json()`  you just want to look at their documentation and dig a little to find out how you can make the most requests possible - because some of their apis do allow batching, or multiple queries at one time"
53,hey what is the best way to write a list of json objects to a file; I was thinking of writing it into a csv; where each row is a basically a json object or should I save it as a json file?
53,"<@Thelma> You should probably either do a CSV, which would mean breaking the JSON into columns in your CSV or just a file where each line is a new JSON object; You could make the JSON a column of the CSV, technically, but that would be kind of awkward to use again"
53,yeah that is very awkward and hard to use I am thinking of latter
53,Are you going to want to search them for anything? If so - you may be best served to dump the contents into a database so you can query and such
53,yeah right now I just want to work with files and if needed we can move to db
53,how big is the file
53,its quite small 1200x250x4 float array is basically what it is
53,dump it as json then either transfor in refine in a matter of seconds or drop it on here if its small enough: <https://konklone.io/json/>
53,oh it is better if I automate it I just dumped as a json object; thanks  guys!
54,"hey guys I have a quick question 
```
dict = {....}
keys = dict.keys()
values = dict.values()
dict2 = dict(zip(keys,values)
```
will dict and dict2 be the same always?"
54,"since dictionaries are unordered, I would suspect the output of zip to produce the same results as the original dict, barring mutation of keys or values; this is my best guess; contents and keys i'm confident in; ordering, not sure but think they probably will be the same; I assume that shallow copy or deep copy is not related to your problem; if uncertain, instead of `dict == dict2` you could ask `all(dict.keys() in dict2)`"
54,"Since dictionaries don't keep order like <@Dorothy> said, the calls to `keys` and `values` are not guaranteed to be in the same order (though the resulting lists _do_ maintain their order but are not created in order). Because of that, zipping them back together will not be equal (because keys may have new values and order may not be the same). However if you used an `OrderedDict` then keys and values lists will maintain order, so calling `zip` in that instance would result in the same results "
55,"hi, i'm getting TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable when using data = request.json(). any ideas why? thanks in advance!"
55,"hi <@Vanetta>, what is `request`?; hrm, I've never used bottle but it looks like `request` is implicit.  Is it safe for me to assume you want to convert the request to json?"
55,<@Winnifred> yeah
55,<@Winnifred> :taco: 
55,"Okay, per <https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/api.html#bottle.BaseRequest.json>, it looks like you can only use that method if the content type header is application/json or application/json-rpc. I'm guessing it's not. You can probably see this if you directly print the `request` object. If you still want to force this to json, you can `import json` then use `json.dumps(request)`.; thanks, <@Beula> :smile:"

58,"Maybe someone has an idea on a bit of a headscratcher I have.
I have a project which essentially is a python app with currently npyscreen ui running on a raspberry pi. The idea is that a user can search for games using the app on the pi. Wonderful, works well. The issue is that I’m aiming it for RetroPie, where the majority of it’s users only have a controller connected, so no keyboard to enter details. How would I solve this? I was thinking of maybe creating an onscreen keyboard, or perhaps have up and down arrows to go down letters of the alphabet and left and right to move the cursor, but then how do you move to the next input box, or button? Anyone have any ideas?"
58,how many button are there on a controller ?
58,"Well say someone has the bare bones, a NES USB controller, you are looking at 4 buttons and D"
58,This is the best I've seen. Navigating through almost 100 keys using left/right is a pain.
58,"True, but the issue there is that it counts on analog. Many users will have USB retro pads like NES and SNES (myself included) which cannot easily move diagonal let alone hold it there. And the NES USB controller has a total of 4 buttons, with only 2 really free to play with, so that makes this perhaps too difficult"
58,Can you do long press? 
58,I should imagine so yes
58,<@Timothy> you could offer two interfaces: one with the controller that is a bit slower for input (maybe also detect NES vs SNES for number of buttons to help us SNES controller users) and another that allows for just using a keyboard as well. i tend to keep a spare logitech wireless keyboard connected to my retropie; also THANK YOU for adding something that is MUCH NEEDED in emulation station; <@Timothy> :taco:

58,"<@Patty> you sound like you have the same setup as me, wireless logitech keyboard and snes usb controller. I think that’s probably the way I’m going to do it. Have it determine whether to use keyboard or on screen and then create an onscreen keyboard if it’s a controller."
58,"I guess I'm late to the retropie discussion, but I would aim for as simple as possible. Assume the user an NES control and nothing more, and if possible avoid an onscreen keyboard, because those are always a pain.

I have an HTPC with a logitech keyboard/touchpad that I use in addition to a XB One control, but I would guess this is the exception rather than the norm. And, it's not retropie, so I like being able to use a browser and other things."

70,"Task Manager shows whether each running process is 32 or 64 bit; Not sure how to verify the installation itself, since I don't use anaconda personally."
71,"hello is there a way  to execute ""curl '<http://example.cm/bla>' --data '{""method"":""wallet_new_address""}'"" but in python way?"
71,look at this module :slightly_smiling_face:
71,"using this &gt;&gt;&gt; payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get('<http://httpbin.org/get>', params=payload); does the '--data' count?"
71,"I think when you use --data with curl, it will do a HTTP POST request, with the data in the request body.; To do the same with `requests`, you'd use `r = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(""<http://httpbin.org/post>"", data=payload)`; So, `<http://requests.post|requests.post>()` instead of `requests.get()` to make a HTTP POST request."
71,"ok, thanks you; gonna try that one"
71,"<@Minh> all the HTTP verbs correspond to a method in `requests`.  Therefore, `PUT` translates to `requests.put(...)`, `GET` as `requests.get(...)`, and so on; <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/>"
72,Hi everyone. Which service or tool for crawling website with javascript? For me i used phantomjs and selenium. But their performance is so poor.
72,"I often use `requests` in combination with `BeautifulSoup` (using the `lxml` parser).; However, that's not a JavaScript solution. Sorry!"
72,<@Mirna> is this some sort of single page web app?
72,Kind of. Because some pages need to excute javasript for rendering full content. So i have to find some browser which can excute javascript for making dynamic crawler.; But according to real life experience. I see phantomjs or selenium is so slow; one minute they can only render 5-6 page; Which cannot serve my purpose
72,Maybe spread the workload out to multiple VMs and let each do a part of the URLspace?
72,<@Mirna> can't you just repeat queries that javascript is making and get the data from the backend directly?
72,Can i make DM with you <@Collette> ?
72,Let's keep our conversation public; I'm not the only one who can help you
72,"Ok. I’m afraid that i will mess our channel.
So the problem is i’m making a crawler which can extract the article main content of any news website.; So for making that i have to get the css and javascript for detecting which is article page and navigation page.; My only bottleneck is page rendering tools. For this i used phantomjs and selenium.; But with their pool performances i can’t really use this for production"
72,"Yeah, you said that a couple of times already."
72,and not the only who need to solve it
72,<@Mirna> have you seen my previous question?
72,"Yup already. But it can’t help. Some web pages make different requests ajax for rendering full content each page. So if i write some algorithm for detecting those request format and fake it. It will make my issue extremely complex. So for reducing the complex, i used some service which can return me the full content after javascript executing.; <@Collette> and sorry for repeating my issue. I just want to centralize again all of my issue."
72,"You still have to parse the returned page, right? Then how parsing different parts is it more complex than rendering everything and parsing parts as a whole?; You don't need to write an algorithm to detect requests. You just need to open the page, to look into web inspector and copy-paste related queries from ""Network"" tab; That's pretty much it"
72,Because I have to find a way to deal with “Any” pages not for specific one as you suggest.
72,"You have to find a way to deal with all pages you're interested in, yes.
If that's such a huge problem, then your only way is to use selenium/headless chrome/whatever"
72,"Yes, so i want to ask if someone had deal with this problem already."
72,"<@Mirna> Apparently your problem is slowness and lack of processing capacity. Maybe using multiple machines is an option?; I mean, instead of machine 1 processing news sites A, B and C in succession, you start 3 machines, where machine 1 will process news site A, machine 2 news site B and machine 3 news site C. That will give a 3x speedup."
72,"Yes i’ve already done that. But i wonder if there is some tool can do this better than phantomjs either selenium. Right now i used 3 servers but only 200 page/ minute has been rendered.
I used cache and proxy and image replacing for reducing the time cost. But it is only slightly better"
72,"sorry to interject, i haven't read everything, but one instance per core (minus 1-2 cores for main process) gives us about 30 headless browsers per machine; on a second-to-largest GCC instance; also, headless chrome :heart:"
72,I used to open 10 instance of headless browser per machine. But the time cost increases with instance of headless browser. More instance ---&gt; more time for rendering.; I don’t know if i’m doing something wrong with that
72,how many cores on these machines?
72,8 cores.
72,10 is too many then :slightly_smiling_face:
72,Anywho thanks for your suggestion with headless chrome. I will take a try with it; :slightly_smiling_face:
73,"so, phantom is notorious for being slow, and having problems; not surprising since its been a one-person project for a number of years now.  given the challenges of browser development, phantom's state of functionality is impressive with that restriction; however, it is now deprecated and no longer supported since headless chrome came out; and unfortunately, this is an instance of where horizontal scaling will have to be used, where you distribute the tasks to be executed among a cluster of similar instances; just like with celery workers, there's a sweet spot that can be hit with tasks on each machine for optimium efficiency, but that takes alot of experimenting to do.; <@Mirna> what instance size are you running this on, and what provider?  AWS, GCC, Azure?"
73,It’s running on my own server company. Not provided by any companies above.
73,then your only option is to either reduce the rate of crawling or add more hardware; because the primary issue is rendering the page and there is a significant lack of options for that
73,Thanks for your advice Jason.
73,good luck

78,<@Beula> Looks so difficult to me :disappointed:
78,"Which part?

1. Automate repetitive tasks: This should be pretty small to start, maybe you check for a stock price every day. Just do it with python instead of logging into a website

2. Small webapp: This is much bigger since you need to also know HTML and CSS"

but if I need to add another stylesheet, how to do it?"
80,You can have as many link elements as you want
80,"and where do I add styles?
in noscript? - it's not working."
80,The noscript stuff only runs when there is no script. So I'm guessing that 'loadCSS.min.js' handles all your stylesheets. I'm guessing that's part of some client-side framework you're using
80,"In General, I can't understand how to make styles with loadcss"
80,Why are you using it?
80,"```  &lt;script async src=""{{ site.baseurl }}/scripts/loadCSS.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

80,You need to understand how loadCSS works if you want to use it
80,it true:slightly_frowning_face:
80,"The standard way to use CSS is the `&lt;link&gt;` element, as seen in the noscript section. If you have those link elements outside of the noscript, they will work; I suggest getting it working properly first, and worrying about optimisation later"
80,"Opening a file in Python - is it relative to the file location calling the file open?; I’m hard coding a path for now, and have `fp = open(""../../../media/images/e772778c-9002-4268-a515-b3ced6175723.png"", ""r"")` but it isn’t finding it. That file does exist though; Or is it best to go from the root?"
80,"Opening a file is much the same in most languages - it's relative to the current working directory, which _might_ be the directory that the program lives in, but it can be anything; What is quite typical is to have the program configuration specify a base directory, and for the application to find files relative to that"

80,"Opening files is something I’ve done very little weirdly :smile: I’ll give base directory a try though, cheers; `requests` is preferred over `urllib2` nowadays I think; <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>; Could also try running it async?

80,<@Temika> could you explain this a bit more? i am not completely clear on how to setup async code; <@Temika> i have experienced issues with `requests` on multiple occasions where the url would not be opened correctly vs. `urllib2` never had this so far. thats why i have opted for the latter

87,<@Hyman> ask away
87,We've been ask as assignment the implementation of Dijkstra's and Bellman Ford's algorithm for calculating the shortest path in a given graph
87,So what's the issue?; run into a problem?
87,I don't really know how to start and that's my problem
87,"Well were you given code to start off with as far as ""i will give you this input"" in order to build the graph you have with the path weights and what not?"
87,The Input to the algorithms is an oriented graph with weights
87,"So then you have to build the graph in the code, yes?"
87,More precisely compute the shortest path from a given source to all the other nodes
87,"I understand that, I am just asking if you have anything to build off of like code given to you to complete the task or if you have to start from scratch and build the graph in code then calculate it."
87,You need to code the algorithm from scratch and supply it with a graph in a text file and it'll calculate the shortest path in it
87,can you give an example input
87,"<@Hyman> how much experience do you have writing code?; for example, there are quite a number of existing examples of the algorithms you're talking about"
87,basic i'm just starting
87,"ok; can you describe the steps on how you execute the algorithm?; and do you understand why those steps are necessary?; if so, then the next step you take is translating your written description of the process into pseudocode; once you have a reasonable sequence of actions, you then implement the pseudocode in your language of choice; frankly, the first two items are always the most difficult; because it requires you to understand the problem domain; once you understand it, making it work is usually much less effort"

88,"Having a syslog server for loggign would be amazing, however the logs get extremely large for some scripts.; One of them produces a log so large the last step in the script is to zip and delete its own logs."
88,"So, what do you actually use the logs for though?; just trying to figure out what went wrong?"
88,"Determine why some data was missed or not parsed correctly, why communication failed on a device, why an exception occurred.; Yeah"
88,I would try using sentry instead of logging; it might change your life

95,"Only tangentially Python related, but does anyone know good ways of generating code-related documents offline? I'm struggling with static blog generators like Pelican because trying to coerce Pelican and Pygments and ReStructuredText to cooperate to do what I want is twisting my mind"
95,"hmm, not python but have you looked at jekyll?"
95,I'm on Windows and Jekyll is a bit awkward on that platform
95,"ah, okay, just thought id toss that one out there"
95,sphinx should be able take care of the pygments and ReStructuredText parts.
95,"I think my problem is that ReStructuredText is really not that good; If you want more control over the formatting, for instance. Rules like ""Multiple successive blank lines are equivalent to a single blank line"" make it awkward to introduce whitespace for readability; And if I want to highlight the code, I can do that in blocks via Pygments, but not in literals"
95,i’ve personally started writing my own markdown filters/extensions for things that I need.
95,"Not sure if anyone can help, but have a quick question regarding <#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows> , powershell more specifically.; <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C5XHHMXHB/p1498673610887626>"

95,"<@Johana>  That sounds useful, especially since I've found that both Markdown and reST each only do about 80% of what I want... a different 80%... but unfortunately I only need to do this one piece of documentation then I'll probably never need it again, so it's hard to justify the time expense"
95,"<@Myong> I believe powershell requires a path be stated to any executable not in the search path. But, a ./myscript.py is sufficient.; Or, in this case, .exe; <@Signe> I showed the lead engineer Sentry. System looks cool, but he thinks we would hit the 20k transactions per day fairly quickly.

97,"Hi, all.
How do I calculate the difference between two dates is best?
The output should only be in months.
The only way I could.
```
In [25]: startDay
Out[25]: datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 0, 0)


In [26]: endDay
Out[26]: datetime.datetime(2017, 1, 1, 0, 0)


In [27]: startDay - endDay
Out[27]: datetime.timedelta(151)


In [28]: different = startDay - endDay


In [29]: different.days//30
Out[29]: 5```"
97,How do you define months in this context?
97,<@Gabriele> sorry?
97,A month is not a fixed unit of time (at least not in the cultures I know of)
97,I need to know how many months have passed between two dates
97,If you want the intuitive answer then I think you will just have to check the difference in years and months individually
97,"for example I started it today - June 2017, and the end - June 2016. The difference - 12 months; I think the best way is to pass the Python..."
97,Does this work? `((endDay.year - startDay.year) * 12) + (endDay.month - startDay.month)`
97,works; Thank you. You are a genius.
97,You can't use timedelta for this because a span of 30 days is over a month if the span starts on Feb 1st and under a month if the span starts on Jan 1st; no problem
97,exactly...
97,"<@Meghan> if you self host, there is no limit; I would recommend that. With docker its really not all that hard to host it; thats what I do. All similar systems will have some type of limit. There is also bugsnag, and rollbar, but they all have limits; self hosting is the only way to have no limits. Oh, I guess google cloud has one called stack-driver that is just a flat monthly fee + minimal data charges"
97,use `dateutil`
97,"or `maya` or `arrow`, etc"
97,That's cheating :wink:
97,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint
&gt;&gt;&gt; start = datetime(2017, 1, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; end = datetime.today()

97,"He may have misread that then, I'll look at it. Thanks."
97,I don't think arrow helps here
97,"if you don't need to do anything complex, dateutil is nice and small"
97,"Just use a unix timestamp and do maths in second offsets :wink: Of course, then there is the problem of leap seconds..."
97,"and often is already installed as a dependency of another package; arrow is cool, but it's for really complex stuff"
97,"just don't use dateutil for parsing, because it often guesses wrong"
97,this way i was able to style it differently in css.
97,<@Johana>  Looks like a good approach. Something I'll consider if I find myself doing this again

97,since at least 1 is true; probably operator

97,"say, a string that is expected to be either `'production'` or `'dev'`, or a int that's only valid for `range(0, 100)`"
99,use an enum?
99,It looks like it-s working
99,I’m running a virtual environment and keep getting this `error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'` when trying to run my script
99,"have you tried google searching for ""requests module"" <@Sherry> ?"
99,"Yes, I know what the requests module is, lol.; Anyway, when I type pip3 list it shows up `requests (2.18.1)`"
99,are you doing that while activated in the virtualenv?
99,yup!; it’s really weird haha
99,<@Sherry> can you try `which python3` and make sure that's the one from that virtualenv? I have had a sourced virtualenv before where somehow the path was screwed up and was using the system python still
99,"seems to be the one from that environment; I created a new file with a single `import requests` line and am still getting the same error, so i’m pretty sure my environment is messed up. I will delete it and try again though"
99,do you have other python3's in your PATH somewhere
99,How can I check? I do notice there’s a 3.51 and 3.6 now
99,"There’s probably a clever command to do it all in one go, but `echo $PATH`will show you your path and you can poke around a few folders to see."
99,`which python3` will show which one is resolved in your PATH
99,it’s showing python 3.5.1; which is weird because when i go into the folders it’s showing python27 files; hmm; i think im fixing it; `virtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 ultra_monitor`; i guess it assumed I wanted python2
99,"maybe check which directories are in a search path, maybe it will help to solve a mystery:

```
print( sys.path )
```"
99,Do that outside of my environment?
99,"Yeah, if you installed `virtualenv` with `python2` (or `pip` from py2) - it will use that interpreter as the default if you don't give the `--python/-p` flag"
99,"hmm, i gave it the python3 flag and it’s still giving the same error"
99,"Silly question, I am sure, but did you `pip install -r requirements.txt` since re-creating the env?"
99,yup!; pip3
99,Figured so :slightly_smiling_face:
99,But it seems to be using my system libraries. Is that weird?
99,"It looks like we have similar environments <@Sherry>. I make my venvs like so `mkvirtualenv --python=""/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3"" new virtualenv`; not exactly the same and I use `mkvirtualenv`"
99,Ahh okay; why is it not `/usr/local/bin/python3`?
99,he installed via the python installer; `/usr/local/bin/python3` is from brew
99,"Thanks, <@Beula>. I actually didn’t have a solid answer there :neutral_face:. These are notes I took a long time ago that became a habit."
99,"Hmm, i still can’t get it to work; I’ve used the `--python=""/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3""` flag when creating the environment; here’s my terminal output from when i CD"
99,what do you get when you run `python -V`
99,A very long output!
99,I think it’s because you don’t have a pip3 under `bin` folder.
99,"capital `V`; you did lowercase, which is a verbose log of the interpreter starting"
99,"so it’s using a default `pip3` which installs libs into `/usr/local/lib`, but search path in environment is looking into `./lib/&lt;version&gt;/site-packages`?"
99,"whoops, sorry!"
99,"Looks like having a space in there is causing your problems; So it's falling back to the system:

```
zsh: /Users/yousefissa/PycharmProjects/Small Projects/HOC/ultra_monitor/bin/pip3: bad interpreter: ""/Users/yousefissa/PycharmProjects/Small: no such file or directory
```"
99,python 3.51; Hmm
99,rename `Small\ Projects` to `small_projects`
99,I can move it to my desktop
99,Or create your virtualenv at `~/.virtualenvs/my_project`; which is pretty standard
99,"Giving it a go; Perfect, that worked! Thank you!; What does adding this (`~/.virtualenvs/my_project`) at the end of the virtual environment actually do?"
99,"It sets the location, is that what you are asking?; `virtualenv -p $(which python3) ~/.virtualenvs/my_project`"
99,it’s the destination of where the virtualenv will be created.
99,"So now you need to `source ~/.virtualenvs/my_project/bin/activate` when you need it; I add that to an `autoenv.zsh` script, so each project in my shell auto-sources.; If you use `virtualenvwrapper` it's even easier:  `mkproject -p $(which python3.6) my_app` and then later you can `workon my_app` and it auto put you in your source :slightly_smiling_face:"
99,Thank you so much guys! I’ve got a lot to learn about virtualenvironments
99,"i use `pyenv` with `pyenv-virtualenv`. both of them together allow you to use a `.python_version` file. The python_version file is kept in the root dir of your project. When you change into the project’s dir it will activate the right virtualenv for you. it’s quite nice although the instructions of getting it going weren’t all too clear.

112,"Anyone ever use the slack api? Is it possible to remove a user from the group??

112,<@Alba> I forgot I found out about this a bit ago - I think this is what you want (the undocumented APIs): <https://github.com/ErikKalkoken/slackApiDoc/blob/master/users.admin.setInactive.md>

113,does anyone know of a way to fetch and update a user with a single db trip in django?
113,<@Lasonya> why?
113,i'm looking for a way to optimise my db calls; <@Collette>
113,<@Lasonya> have you profiled your views? Are you sure fetching and updating users is the most expensive operation?
113,well for large data sets it sure is <@Collette>. how do you mean 'profiled your views '?
113,I mean what makes you think that this is the most expensive operation? Do you _think_ so or you have profiled your code so you _know_ it's the most expensive operation?
113,"Looking up one record in your user table, and updating that record, is really the bottleneck? That sounds quite suprising to me, too."
113,"That may be the bottleneck, for sure. Which is likely to be fixed by creating a proper index."
113,anyways in sql you are able to retrieve data from an `update` query
113,<@Ruben> <@Collette> won't it be performant to have one db trip to fetch and update rather than have two trips?
113,"<@Lasonya> please, google about premature optimization"
113,Your remark smells like premature optimisation
113,Ha
113,i like this <@Ciera>
113,"<@Ciera> Some DBMSses indeed can, see RETURNING clause in PostgreSQL's UPDATE. <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-update.html>"
113,yeah that's what I was referring to
113,...but don't expect such things to work in MySQL or Oracle.; I never found the need to return something from an UPDATE (except maybe the nr. of records that were changed) because what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway.; <@Ciera> So I'm curious about for what you want such a feature.
113,we use it from time to time when we need to return ids for some processing (for example)
113,"&gt; what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway
Not when there is an SQL function / expression in an UPDATE clause"
113,you have available what you put in the update but you might not have all the row; if you have read only data for example
113,"Ah ok, I see. That might be handy indeed."
113,I have to add: I don't think `UPDATE ... RETURNING ...` will increase performance substantially for a typical web app; even the fastest ORM (something like Peewee) is still quite slow
113,if your db is on the network you gain a bit; but otherwise not really. It's just a nice to have
113,"plus if I can get an empty page in 30 ms and a heavy page in 40 ms, then there is no point in optimizing just yet"
113,Thanks guys <@Ciera>  <@Ruben>  <@Collette>  <@Suellen> :taco:

117,"what model mac, windows, etc.?"
117,mac!
117,on a mac i install brew and then install python2 and python3. you definitely don’t want to use system python for anything.; then i use penv to manage python versions and virtualenvs.
117,ahh ok
117,"Yeah, mac is popular enough I can focus on it. Then I can learn windows :stuck_out_tongue:; I'll try to do it over the weekend and it'll be free"
117,Thanks!!
117,windows you just install python from the msi.; and make sure you check the box to add python to the path.
117,Yah i’m trying to install virtualenvwrapper; but am getting that; my virtualenvwrapper seems to be here `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`

117,Just the last line should be sufficient 
117,i trimmed it down to those two.

117,the last two lines you paste into your shell config
117,yup
117,you could run them yourself from the command line but that isn’t too efficient to do every time you open a terminal.
117,ahh ok; thanks!
117,if you ever use pyenv you will need to do something similar.
117,"It’s bad practice to use folders with spaces when making the virtual environment, right?"

117,"lots of things have changed in ansible now.; yea, i was a bit confused by them when i first started.; i was thankful for those few tutorials i found that really went through creating those."
117,why would i want the virtual environment in the standard environment folder and not in my project folder?
117,i remember on my first projects i pushed to github i had committed my virtualenv.; lol; when you need to manage python versions.
117,haha ouch; my first push had my twitter app tokens!
117,yea that was bad. i’ve never done that but i’ve done some google hacks to look at when ppl did that.
117,"Haha yah, luckily it was just a monitor i was setting up."
117,i ran a python script to use a custom google search with a googlehack string and then i had splunk index all the results. since the api only allowed a certain amount of calls for free I ran a cron daily.; i did my due diligence and contacted ppl.
117,Yeah the main problem with vanilla virtualenv is you end up with folders all over the place and management is a mess
118,Is pyenv still used a lot?
117,If I don't use virtualenvwrapper I use pipenv or just docker (but local dev with docker on python isn't the best since you still need a local install for code completion
117,Hmm I get code completion in webstorm doing local docker dev. I mount the volume where the code is
117,"Node uses `node_modules` which is a sibling of the project, python uses `site-packages` which isn't - so my guess is that may be why"

117,Node is fun but callbacks are a headache haha
117,"Yeah, maybe that works - but then why bother with developing in docker?; callbacks are getting less and less common <@Sherry> , at least! :slightly_smiling_face:"

123,"Hi, I need a suggestion. I am planning to start a new project for logging user analytics using MongoDB. 
Which framework will be better to use with Mongo - Flask or Django?"
123,flask
121,at one point in time around django 1.4 mongo was great with django but then ppl stopped maintaining some core libraries.
123,"+1 for that use case; Though if you are doing user analytics, you may need something lower latency since that may be a ton of events"
123,i built my recent highlighter with elastic search. it worked really well. I would imagine throwing kibana on there could make for a neat analytics platform.; <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>
123,<@Johana> Can you tell me more about it?
123,i’ve built an elk stack for logging at my old place of employment. it depends on what you mean by analytics :wink:.; you could analyze the data with scripts and use things like stochastic gradient descent and things like that or you can build dashboards.; not sure how you’re trying to check out these events.; we used the logs to determine if there were issues in the network.
123,"I will log request, pageviews and other user actions."
123,do you have any experience with flask?; or python web frameworks?; i try not to assume things.
123,Yes I've decent experience on django
123,k; just a sec let me bust out a code sample.
123,I can learn flask fast; pycharm is slow :stuck_out_tongue:
123,i also had to get my kid off of the table.
123,okay
123,for user analytics you could use django or flask. to get the user events you’ll need some sort of middleware. i’m not talking about that part. what i’m showing is how to get data into elastic search.; once you have data in elastic search then the kibana parts comes into play but you will also need to figure that part out.
123,ok; Waiting :slightly_smiling_face:
123,"ya, wondering if i should make a big gist. there are several things involved."
123,ok take your time :slightly_smiling_face:
123,"dang i need to edit this in a bigger window. lol; either way, in flask you’ll need to do something like that and establish a connection with elastic search.; when your app starts up.; there may be a flask-extension for it already; where you can simply add in the right settings."
123,ok then
123,i’ve updated it with the model. you need to create a model to describe how your document is structured.; oh cool. yea you can use this :smiley: <https://github.com/chiangf/Flask-Elasticsearch>
123,You used Flask + ES + Kibana?
123,no kibana; in my project recently.; my past project with ES and Kibana didn’t have flask
123,How did you build dashboard?
123,i built the dashboard with kibana.; flask is only involved in this process b/c it’s generating the event.; i’m just showing how to save data to elastic search in python with a flask view. once you have data in EL then you can use Kibana to do analytics. Kibana could be installed on a totally different server.; hmm.. i could probably PR this elastic search model code i have with this flask extension.; it’s nice mapping a document to a class.
123,"Yeah, that will be nice."
123,i know it’s a lot of pieces there and gaps but you get started down the path you will get each working :wink:.
123,i've few questions.
123,k
123,"Can you tell me about the architecture part, or process flow.; Is it something like this - 
1. User creates an event.
2. Flask view logs data in ES.
3. Kibana gets data from ES and shows it in dashboard.; Aren't you using any async tasks queues like rabbitmq or kafka?"
123,you could but in the most basic sense you would use the middleware to do a post on elastic search with the data about the event.
123,"I found this blog post for similar usecase - <http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/|engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/>
They used kafka + rabittmq + mongodb + S3 + redshift to build complete architecture; ES will be better than this?"
123,"oh idk about that. i haven’t used all those before. what i proposed was for something simpler but it could grow to using those things once you need “web scale”. hence, the “logging millions of requests everyday”."
123,"okay, thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Now I should connect the dots using the code you provided.; One quick question, how many servers u used? What will be minimal cost to setup this?"
123,"yea, i’m thinking i may need to do an example app for this now.; do you already have a site you’re trying to integrate this into?; or your just interested in getting it going on your own site?"
123,I want to integrate it to a website running on Django.
123,<https://qbox.io/blog/how-to-elasticsearch-python-django-part1>
123,cost involved?
123,oh idk the cost we had our own vm infrastructure.
123,How many VMs you used?
123,there was a central server that ran logstash and the elastic search server with kibana so 2 servers. we also had another server running OSSEC.; it’s been a few years now. i’ve slept since then and don’t remember all the details as i’m not involved in networking admin anymore.; <https://qbox.io/blog/welcome-to-the-elk-stack-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana>; i remember our biggest problem was storage.; there was also grokking all the different kinds of logs.; the one big gripe about ES is that it’s easy to get data in there but hard to take it back out. to combat this while you save a document for EL to index you can also create a record in a relational db. this will help for other kinds of reporting.; for logs we didn’t care about the relational db part. we needed to analyze them in real-time and then archive them.; you can also get ES running super quick with docker.
123,Why RDBMS and not MongoDB?
123,"well ES is already a document store. using something like Mongo would be redundant but i guess if you wanted to you could.; it’s generally not a good idea to try and do things a relational database can do in a document database like joins. i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.; this is my docker-compose.yml for ES:
```
version: '3'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: nickstenning/elasticsearch-icu
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:9200:9200'
```

you can type `docker-compose up` and it will start the service for you."
123,"So I should store data in both, ES and RDBMS if I want to access it frequently?"
123,i don’t know what you should do b/c i don’t know the requirements i was just letting you know what you could do :wink:; &gt; i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdbms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.
123,"Hmm. By storing document in RDBMS, did you mean creating schema based on keys in document?"
123,"yea, you can save the data to the db and get back from the database the inserted record. That would look like this maybe `{""id"": 1, ""name"": ""a1gupta"", ""role"": ""1"", ""created_on"": ""2017-10-11 343434""}`. once you get what the database has you send it to ES.; that’s how you would make a search engine with ES btw. which is what i did recently. you can take those same values in the dict and pass them as query params to a search endpoint."
123,Thanks <@Johana> . I think I should start now to understand it better. :upside_down_face:
123,code it the way you see it :smiley: it looks like there may be a few problems to solve before getting to ES like getting the events you want.; i’m sure there are some django plugins that can help you with that.; ppl in the <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel would know.
124,"I have something seemingly complex and puzzling. I’m trying to add dynamic localization to my library which also powers a REST API. I was able to add the gettext _() function by running this at my root before importing the other modules

```
LOCALE = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'locale')
gettext.install('app, LOCALE)

from app import foo, bar
```

That works great. However, I want to add dynamic localization for certain functions. Ex:

```
# Using system
foo()
# Using given locale
foo(lang='es')
# Goes back to system
foo()
```

I’m trying to do this by running within a context switcher:

```
@contextmanager
def set_language(lang: str=None):
    # Set language
    if not lang is None:
        gettext.translation('app', LOCALE, languages=[lang], fallback=True).install()
    yield
    # Revert to system default
    gettext.install('app', LOCALE)

def foo(lang: str=None):
    with set_language(lang):
        print(_('Foo the bar'))
```

But I’m getting this opaque error and can’t figure out how to isolate it

```
print(_('Foo the Bar'))
TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable
```

The interesting part is that it works on the first call to foo but not the second. My guess is that something is going on after the `yield` which screws the system up, but I’m not sure where, why, or how to ask the right question; OH MY GOD. I’ve been testing this in the REPL. I have a function which returns a boolean that gets “thrown away”, but the REPL assigns it to `_` which overwrites the global `_` set by `gettext.install()`; Thoughts on how to make gettext REPL-safe?"
124,<@Elane> don't use `install`?

128,"In PyCharm, can you have the project run kick off a bunch of things at once? For example, I want to run Django, Celery Workers, and Celery Beat"

131,"<@Suellen> the first two data frame which has common columns normally unites, the problem with the third.
the third has no common poles with the first two.
the `merge` would be for the first and second if I understand correctly.
But why? And so they're fine."
131,"Due to having no common columns and no index, the third df is just appended to the end; df.merge will merge the third df and the big one despite no common data between them"

132,"[silly] question for the slack bot experts: in many examples I keep seeing a variable named BOT_ID, what is this ID? All I get from slack is the bot token"
132,that's not a silly question. It's the id of your bot that slack return when you use <https://api.slack.com/methods/rtm.connect>; or `rtm.start` it's useful to filter message coming from your bot; but normally they shouldn't need it as they can easily retrieve it for you
133,"this is a pretty basic questions - but when an exception is thrown the rest of the code after where the exception occurred is not executed unless it was handled in a `try` `except`?; I'm deciding whether I should test code with a context manager of an object that throws an exception, although I don't think I am correct in the what happens"
132,yes. you can add a `finally` if you want a piece of code to always be executed; it depends on the what but in some case it can overlapp yes
133,"so let's say that's the code and we're expecting a new_object to be created based on the paramteters, but an exception can occur like a URLError or something; what I'm trying to do is test the correct exception is thrown/handled; so I was thinking..."
133,`as new_object` looks strange to me
133,If you are testing code I believe both pytest and unitest have special context manager to test errors
133,"just do
```
with self.assertRaises(URLError):
    new_object = NewObject(param_to_cause_exception)
```"
133,yah that is unittest
133,"also, don't test anything else in this function; you're testing only the fact that wrong URL causes an exception"
133,in that case if the assert is correct the test will continue as expected
133,with the `as new_object` I can pass it through the rest of the code as an exception object which I found here<https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises>
133,but <@Suellen> make a good point; oh ok. You want to test what is in the exception ?
133,thanks <@Suellen> that does make sense; right; and how the rest of the code responds to that <@Ciera> if that makes sense
133,both object have the same name that's a little confusing; you can interact with the exception after the `with` like any other object. For example to check what's inside
133,"right, check error codes and such; I think I was incorrectly thinking of how the object would be handled if an exception was thrown (not under test); in my test I am asserting the correct exception is thrown given a bad parameter; I think I've got it from here thanks guys <@Suellen> :taco: <@Ciera> :taco:; I think I just gave you guys 2 tacos each but you guys were great so keep 'em"
133,thanks good luck :slightly_smiling_face:
134,Best way to order a list based on another list?
134,there is something like `sorted()`; and I guess you can pass like a lambda to do custom sort
134,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; order = ['b', 'c', 'a']
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(['a', 'b', 'c'], key=order.index)
['b', 'c', 'a']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
```"
134,yeah <@Vada> helped me on the django channel. btw have a :taco:
134,<@Suellen> :taco: I missed that you could just provide order.index instead of a full on lambda. This will be much better

135,so this should work :confused:
135,yes; if you do `dig www.my_awesome_website` you should see the result

140,Anyone knows how to set an script to run every 2nd sunday in a month ?
140,linux/mac/windows ?
140,Linux. I'm using crontabs on django-beat; I haven't found a way to do that using a crontab
140,there must be :stuck_out_tongue:
140,I have seen some hacking with bash but i think i don't have that available; just a plain crontab
140,don't have shell? how?
140,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11683387/run-every-2nd-and-4th-saturday-of-the-month>; it seems you need a small bash script indeed
140,The crontab is ran by a scheduler built with on top of celery. Introducing the equivalent to the bash script will involve too much hacking i think; meh. I'll just run the script every sunday (well they are celery tasks). And have the task checking if it's on the week that i want
140,that should be the easiest
140,I saw that the weekdays and the day of the month are an `or` proposition on crontabs
140,I imiagne you could also run it only between the 7 and the 14 and only check if it's sunday; more like 7 - 13 :stuck_out_tongue:
140,That too. Or run it every sunday and check if it's between 7 and 14. I think this option will run less unnecessary times. There isn't much load on the system that i'm building so it doesn't matter; :taco: <@Ciera>

144,"What do you mean by 'learning language'? This is a VERY wide field; Are you familiar with word2vec? It's not the 'most' state of the art but it represented a big step forward a few years ago and is widely used; (You might also reach a more specific audience in <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning> , but there are fewer people there)"
144,"Hello guys, I got a huge problem"
144,"Cool, thanks! No worries, biking and grilling should always take precedence."
145,<@Hyman> best to say your problem
144,OK bro here it comes
144,"someone will read it and say something, but you need to put your issue out first"
144,There is a website and a WiFi network. And what i want to do is to automatically connect any person on my WiFi to the website without theme authenticate themselves directly on the website
144,"Simple, flippant answer: disable authentication on your website"
144,"No no, that isn't that. Persons on my WiFi can connect themselves but those out of it need to authenticate themselves"
144,do you have a static IP?
144,"No, no static IP"
144,"then sorry; if you had a static IP through your ISP, then you could check the IP address on the incoming request; and then filter to authentication if necessary"
144,"If you're on a Windows domain you can do more, but that's a bit specialized"
144,"can you run custom code on the wifi router?  you might be able to have it regularly send its ip; when it updates you might have a moment where the site isn’t accessible, but it might do the trick."
144,My problem now is to authenticate a person from it's IP address since I don't want to change even the website code
144,"why?; ok, better step back and describe things in more detail; because it sounds like you're trying to do some things that are not advisable"
144,"and depending on how secure you want this, IP whitelisting may not be the best bet"

If a person is connected to my WiFi, he can access the website with no problem, but if he is not in my WiFi, he should enter a passcode before proceeding to the site's content"
145,why?
144,"why do you want to have such a huge hole in your authentication; just have them sign in; and keep a session cookie active for them; and so when they re-access the site, their login session is still active"
144,"I've seen this sort of thing done before to facilitate company intranets, and that's done primarily just by virtue of listening on an inward-facing network address. But sometimes there is still extra auth anyway, because it's not a great hardship."
144,Is it the case that it’s irrelevant *who* the user is that accesses content?  i.e. there is no user data specific to a user?
144,...also that.
144,"if it’s truly irrelevant who people are, then yeah, I’d combine <@Gabriele>’s comment with a VPN from the wifi router to the network that second interface is on"

155,"well this is all sorta new to me as far as testing goes I haven’t done it much in the past but I want to mainly ensure the code works and get back proper responses, etc; since its basically a bot"
155,"So there are various levels of testing. If you want a lot of confidence, you should do `end-to-end` testing; which basically means you spin up your app, then use `requests` to hit the api's and check that they actually work; an integration test would be just calling the handler, not using http. And a unit test would only check the logic of one function alone, as in, the function where the logic is"
155,"yea basically the end to end is what I want; take the code spin up the flask app and make calls to the routes to verify they work; before it deploys the code to heroku, etc; so this will be a part of my jenkins setup; I’ve never done testing in the past lol need to learn how to integrate it into my projects"
155,"Unfortunantly I dont know of any ""api testing frameworks"" in python"
155,its more of how do I test flask
155,but its really not very hard to just write tests that use requests
155,since its a flask app
155,and call your app
155,yea if thats all it is I guess I can do that
155,You also might want to look at: <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/testing/>; or ask more questions in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>
155,"I was more curious how I test it and where for example where do I spin up the code and test it or does it just do it all local, etc; yea I’ve been looking over that doc; problem is that one is very db driven and I’m not even using a db yet, just want to test simple flask routes, maybe I’ll just go the route of requests; I’ll see what I can find, thanks"
155,if you dont have a DB then ignore the DB code; the rest will still work
155,yea thats why I’m checking it out just wasn’t sure if there was anything else or if this is the only info I’ve asked in flask too; didn’t realize they had a channel

But as the sub-tasks are executing asynchronously, with no feedback to the parent task, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to update the db on completion of the last sub-task.; Only thing I can think of is for each subtask to increment/update the db record on completion.  Is there a more elegant way to do this with Celery?"

159,"correct; thus, the different queues"
159,"It would only block on 1 worker; But yeah, in that case - DB increment seems like the option"
159,"alright, thanks; nice to know I'm on the right track :slightly_smiling_face:"
159,<@Collette> - any other thoughts :point_up::skin-tone-4: ?
159,"nobody else here uses python or the tools I use, so its good to get confirmation; he's probably sleeping right now; but woould be interested in his and <@Patty>'s feedback as well"

159,no its someone using RUBY of all things spamming us with bad requests
159,snowbound seven months of the year; the rest you're bone dry; <@Beula> having fun with Joe's API?; :smile:
159,LAWL; Can ruby run fast enough to spam it?
159,eventually; probably not DDOS level of spam though; like the one that took down kreb's blog
159,"oh yeah, that was crazy; that was the IoT hack, IIRC"
159,"yep; well, I'm out; time to get home and head out on the bike for a bit; good evening/night/morning!"
160,no ruby cant DDOS aws im sure :stuck_out_tongue:
159,we have a really bad customer that spams us a lot with bad requests and they seem to do it scripted and its 400 400 400 400 and they dont handle errors in their scripts so it just keeps going
160,:facepalm:
159,"<@Meg> I was going to suggest `on_success` with a handler to write results to the db; you could also get the values from calling it e.g.,: ```
result = task.apply_async(*args, **kwargs)
result.collect() # after processing is complete this list grows```; <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/reference/celery.result.html>"
160,"personally i prefer `on_success`, however i would then make sure that if there is an error that you handle responding with either how many were indexed, or bail the whole indexing out (probably not this because lol solr reindexing speeds); or you can consider ANY indexing a “success” and still use `on_success`; man, i miss my job where i did a ton of celery and solr"
161,"Yeah, I'll probably do that in the master task, combined with polling of the subtasks. When the subtasks complete, the master will finish as well, and then can handle success, failure, etc"
161,Oh so Joe suggests it and now it's okay the master task blocks! table flip /s
162,Is abort() not a flask function anymore?
162,<@Sherry> it is; <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/api/#flask.abort>

163,"Ha, no. I'm combining both your suggestions! :grinning:"
164,"Hi again, I have a flask app that I am running that is collecting real time slack data from my slack server. I am appending messages to a list (i’m using RTM in python) and need my flask app to constantly allow get requests to view the messages. I am having a hard time figuring out threading with flask. Are there any good guides to do so?"
164,Try using some type of caching system like redis. Every flask request lives in it's own thread. So communication between them can be hard and i think it's not recommended; try to use something like `redis` to store that list

167,Hi; Does anyone have experience in `protobuf`? I want to know how to map a `dictionary` to `protobuf`. I’ve tried this one : `<https://github.com/davyzhang/dict-to-protobuf>`. But it doesn’t work in nested case.
167,"<@Mirna>
found in one of my projects:
`from protobuf_to_dict import protobuf_to_dict, dict_to_protobuf`; The library is called `protobuf3-to-dict`; And it handles nested data"
167,Ah I see thx <@Suellen>
167,There's also <https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/python/google/protobuf/json_format.py#L112> that from the protobuf library
167,So I ended up trying to use Flask-HTTPAuth as recommended in this thread <https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/issues/492> however I'm getting `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'as_view'` even with the most basic demo code. I'm not sure why it wouldn't work...
167,<@Carri> Thx a lot Christ :smile:
167,"Well, functions don't have `as_view`"
167,"Yes, but I'm not sure why it would be doing that in the first place. I'm just using the standard Flask, Flask-Restful, and Flask-HTTPAuth libraries like in the project, but the `@auth.login_required` decorator throws that error. The project linked in the thread uses it in the same way but apparently doesn't have that problem...; I have all the requirements installed so... :confused:"
167,<https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/blob/ff64cdbef03aa2ce108a7dc06ca336035ec68b70/flask_restful/__init__.py#L444>; Flask-restful registers a view like this; and the view is supposed to be a class; which have an `as_view` method it seems; but `@auth.login_required` returns a function. do you apply this decorator to a class?
167,Oh shooooooooooot!! Wow! You're right! I had it on a class rather than a function.; Thanks a million!
167,:slightly_smiling_face: you're welcome
167,"I gotta keep learning, maybe someday I can be as good with Python as you seem to be. :smile:"
168,Is it considered bad practice to append the working dir to the `sys.path` ?
168,i think it may be frowned upon. i usually try to avoid it but when i need alembic `env.py` to be aware of my metadata i do this so that i can import it and have it do autogenerated migrations. The benefits i get out of that are huge so i think it’s worth appending to the sys.path.
168,"In general cases, yes"
168,ok. It's the only solution I found for <@Alesia> to import plugins without the need to have them installed
168,`python -m sirbot` would add the CWD; if sirbot is an executable module
168,yeah but it's ugly :smile: there is a `sirbot` entry point; so it's just `sirbot --config file`
168,then make them pip installable!
168,yeah they should be but your custom config is also a plugin; so making a `setup.py` and installing that every them you modify isn't very user friendly
168,What's the config look like?
168,ya pip installable would fix it
168,my solution is to add to the sys path only on `ModuleNotFoundError` so if every thing is installed no problem
168,"Is it not just a yaml in `~/.sirbotrc`; if that works and it makes the user experience better, that's a good solution"
168,yes but you also need to do your business logic; what sirbot-pythondev is to us; just wanted to know if it was `oh my god never do that` or more `best not to but hey it's python go ahead`
168,The latter :slightly_smiling_face:; Making a better user experience is worth it if only the library has to deal with it!
169,"Single, otherwise it includes all that whitespace "
170,Hey guys reading some idiomatic Python and saw they had a pattern match on a tuple. Just wondering what `user` would look like here for this to be able to work
170,"It's just iterable unpacking, you don't need the parens even for it. The ""user"" here is some sequence type.

You can do that with dicts I think now, but only 3.6+ retain order"
170,"try `(name,age) = chase.values()`, can't confirm the order "
170,Thanks guys :)) I see what you mean now <@Beula> and <@Shelly> got it to do what i wanted it to do haha

180,ugh... sounds weird. Are you pulling from an HTTP repository then?
180,"The hash mismatch problem seems fixed by going to the local directory where the issue occurred and running `svn update --set-depth empty` then `svn update --set-depth infinity`; <@Gabriele> yes; It's a outside hosted server; outside of our network that is; Also occasionally run into hanging on update. I use the CLI cause the GUI is just way too slow having to cleanup due to locked repo.; Where in the console it will just sit for a while; and eventually I have to `ctrl-c` and then `svn cleanup` and `svn update`; It probably wouldn't be such a huge PITA, but it's a massive repo"

182,"that looks invalid, `--link` requires an argument; I am saying, just use what you originally posted, but in your app code where you connect to the database, use the hostname `my-db`; What lib are you using to talk to your DB?"
182,"mysql-python; and uri for now

184,I think the network shared drive is doing something weird with the last accessed date

184,"yeah since it’s probably managed through AD; basically, it’s a combination of python, Windows, PowerShell, and Active Directory in a storm of a mess"

186,Thanks.; Full code to the above: <https://github.com/TomFaulkner/pypihole>
186,"<@Meghan> the easy answer is that you should never change the indexes/order on a named tuple; Thats a breaking change. If your concerned about that, you should probably use a class or dictionary and not let people use indexes"
186,"Yeah, I think I probably have to agree there. As nice as namedtuples are, that does make it easy to break things should the data being analyzed changed."
186,"<@Meghan> Are you trying to get the index of the property, when you first defined it?
`Query._fields.index('client')`; Not sure if I understood correctly"
186,"You did, that works well.; However, it also starts with an underscore. I can't imagine standard lib changing that, but...; Actually, in the case of a namedtuple, it might make sense to do the underscore to avoid someone naming one of their fields 'fields' and breaking things."

188,"Python supports dictionary comprehensions, `port2 = {value:key for key, value in port1.items()}` so iterating the `key, value` pair from each item of the dictionary, and switching their positions for the comprehension will work"

this is what i did 

res = dict((v,k) for k,v in port1.items())

and works fine"
188,<@Reina> You can also use `zip` to build a dictionary from a sequence of keys and a sequence of values:

port_to_service = dict(zip(ports, services))

t = Timer(20 * 60, get_new_api_keys)

190,You’re better off using `crontab` over keeping script running. Better chances of it running successfully because a long-running process can die for a lot of reasons
190,or a slightly more complete example for a recurring timer <https://stackoverflow.com/a/24488061/69893>
190,"if you really want to get complex, you can write a daemon; and hook into systemd or something to run"
190,"other options could be using signals, and trapping `SIGHUP`, and using a cronjob to send a `kill -HUP $(pgrep APPNAME)`; and have your signal handle in your python app to refresh API keys on receiving a HUP"
190,at that point may as well just run the script with cron itself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
190,"cron isn't going to kill your script if it runs perpetually, it'll just spawn another instance"

190,"Your script should terminate when it is done. If you make it loop forever, you have a problem."
190,"yes, loop forever, because export some data for monitoring over API"
190,"Maybe it's better to use the Timer-based solutions suggested above, and use `supervisord` to make sure the script always runs (and is restarted if it ends for whatever reason). In that case you don't have to use a cron job.; Also, do the API keys expire on certain fixed times, or exactly two hours after they have been generated?"
190,API expires after 2 hours of starting script
190,How does the API provider know when you start your script? Does the script ask for keys when it starts for the first time?
190,"Yes, script do first get request and then give some code which I use in params when doing new request to API. After 2 hours this code expires and my export of data stop."
190,are you continually hitting an API and just need the re-register of the API key to run every 2 hours?
190,"Yes, but I have while loop forever !"
190,"<@Tristan> but between getting the new API keys you are running other requests, correct? Also, what site is this? There may be a way to get longer API keys"
190,"Joe, I get this code from api and then I request one api every 15 seconds in ```while True: ``` loop  and parsing response. After 2 hours code expires and my loop don’t have response. This is proxmox KVM virtualization."
190,"ah okay, yeah then the previous mentions of daemonizing the process is probably your best bet"
192,"Hey, versioning and giving my commits build numbers is something I've neglected for a while. How should I go about it?

193,"Hey guys, I'm trying to run Docker (with a Debian image) on a Mac. My Python installation on Mac has case-sensitive imports but not in Docker, and this is breaking the `queue` module which has both `queue` and `Queue`.

194,"Thanks <@Suellen> - I'll take a gander. Looks pretty neat, and likely that I could just define a nested function to make sure the state is kept correctly across paged requests; Oh man, that lib showed me `pook`, which looks pretty awesome for testing"
194,"<@Junita> I did more research on my problem. It seems on Mac/Windows, Python enforces case-sensitivity with import at compilation. Because I run Debian in Docker on Mac, Python does not enforce case-sensitivity (it's Debian) but the filesystem is not case sensitive, so import does not distinguish cases. One of my dependencies uses `queue`, which internally imports `Queue`. Without case-sensitivity, it causes circular import, where `queue` imports itself. There are others reporting this type of issue: <https://forums.docker.com/t/python-import-source-files-from-docker-volumns-can-not-distinct-upper-lower-cases-in-lib-name/20527> . I worked around this with a very ugly hack, by appending the path of `Queue` at the front of `sys.path` right before a call that results in `queue` getting imported, and then I delete the path from `sys.path` after. I only need this for development so it seems to be OK."
194,"I’d be shocked if there’s a case mistake in the python standard library.  It was Queue in Python 2, and is queue in Python 3 - are you sure perhaps it’s not an issue of the python version?"
194,"Looks like there is some platform-specific case-handling behavior (PEP 235) and it predates things like Docker, so maybe it's not surprising it gets confused"
194,Right but the general issue for people using Docker on Mac is that it’s “Linux” so the file system isn’t case-sensitive.  This isn’t so much a Docker issue as an issue of people being exposed to a case-sensitive file-system
194,"I think the `queue` is for backwards compatibility for 3 to 2; ```

```; The import on line 6 is circular without case-sensitivity"
194,"Well there is a class Queue in the Queue module, maybe that’s messing it up?   What happens if you do `from Queue import Queue`?"
194,"The issue was, that small piece of code tries to import `Queue`, while it itself is `queue`, which effectively allows code to import python2 `Queue` even though they refer to python3 `queue`; But it broke without case-sensitivity; The actualy implementation of `Queue` is perfectly fine"
194,oh - is your python file itself named queue.py?

DESCRIPTION
    This module performs file control and I/O control on file 
    descriptors.  It is an interface to the fcntl() and ioctl() Unix
    routines.  File descriptors can be obtained with the fileno() method of
    a file or socket object.

198,"<@Meghan> yeah that is consistent with what I'm seeing after some further reading, but why would that happen when following the Windows instructions?"
198,<@Noemi> can you link the instructions you are following?
197,<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html>
197,Hmm. But pip was happy when you ran the install?
199,"Hey, I've been working with python lately, and I think I have most of the basic stuff down, but I'm kinda lost as to where to go moving forward, and so I wanted to ask if there was any advice for going 'beyond the basics', and really getting confident with python and everything it has to offer. Thanks!"
199,Build something with it!
199,doesn’t sirbot have a command for what’s next?; nice <@Elena> :point_up:
199,It's `/file &lt;name&gt;`
199,ah ok
199,Is the interpreter set up right? 
199,yeah. I'm restarting the IDE
200,pycharm can't handle my code :100:
199,too good for it.
199,"Haha, woot; :dagger_knife: "
199,ha. Missed the `{}` around the json response. It wasn't that wrong
199,"Haha, yep. I was looking at general structure vs details "
201,Hi guys! Anyone who knows how to set up queued or delayed mails in django? Kind of like how you do in Laravel
201,<@Zackary> have you looked at something like django-celery?
201,"<@Junita> No - I will have a look at it. Thanks!; <@Junita> btw, do you know anything about best practice for using environment vars in Django? It’s very easy with Laravel, pulling the env vars from a .env file… But django doenst seem to do it that way.

So far, I have just placed an env.py file in the root of the project, and imported it into my settings.py."
201,"yeah I actually wrote a little tool to simplify doing that in my python projects: <https://github.com/jimjkelly/yaep>; but the basics if you don’t want anything fancy is just `os.getenv(KEY, default)`; oh, and loading the `.env` file I suppose"
201,"Okay, thanks <@Junita>"
201,"Yeah, pip was happy, confirmed that all of my dependencies are there too. I am puzzled"
202,I'm using Flask and have fallen victim to the surprisingly common circular dependency issue. Do I pretty much have to use an app factory pattern to get around this?
202,"<@Thomasina> pretty much, if you have source to look at we may be able to suggest something else, but my guess is the factory is the simplest way"
202,"I also found that it helped to avoid various flask extensions, because they would usually mean dragging in a further dependency on the `app` object to implement whatever behavior the extension added"
202,<@Thomasina> Here is a sample app we deprecated from <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> - <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old>
202,"<@Beula> Well, my current code works, _but_ I'm making use of `from models import *` and using any other method of import fails. I heard that importing like that should generally always be avoided though. I'm not entirely sure why that is (yet) so I'm not sure if it's worth fussing over or if I might as well continue with it as is.; <@Gabriele> I'm using several Flask extensions, but I suppose the issue in this case comes from Flask-SQLAlchemy specifically. I'm wondering why the extensions exist if they're so prone to these problems though? Is the user just expected to use an app factory pattern? I'm surprised that even the most basic Flask tutorials seem to have this issue. The first tutorial I ever did wouldn't run due to a circular import error, even though the tutorial didn't mention any error and seemed to produce the correct results of the app running as if there was no error."
202,It's discouraged because it pollutes the namespace with everything from `models`; Including its imports
202,All I can say is that I stripped Flask-SQLAlchemy out for exactly this reason. Other people managed to coerce it into working. :slightly_smiling_face:
202,"for example:

```
# module a.py
import secrets

def do_thing():
    pass

# module b.py
from a import *
locals()   # will have do_thing and secrets available...!
```"
202,<@Gabriele> To be frank the reason I'm using the extension is because it seemed a lot more straightforward to use than SQLAlchemy by itself. Guess I'll have to choose between app factory and that.
202,Any reason you dislike the app factory? I'd say the extension is worth it IMO
202,"I have an app factory, and even that didn't solve all my problems, because various functionality likes to have the app at module-level for decorators, etc"
202,"<@Beula> Despite being a coder for longer than I'd like to specify, I've never had to implement an app factory pattern, and I'm wondering how much learning there would be. I generally learn pretty quickly but I am on a fairly tight schedule."
202,"It depends on if you need to import the app elsewhere to work with it, I usually avoid that (but sometimes you cant)"
202,Also wondering if that is in fact the best move considering what Kylotan said. If implementing the pattern would still leave me with import issues later on...well...it sounds like it could be more efficient to just ditch problematic extensions
202,"In those cases, I use an `init_app` in a module that initializes the top level things that need to be decorated by `@app`; I can't say I have had those issues; You just need to pass the app around sometimes during the startup/bootstrap phase"
202,The app factory is really simple. Giving it the name 'factory' makes it sound like some sort of complex pattern but really it's just a function that returns a thing.
202,"Yeah, I added a link to a thread above <@Thomasina> for reference"
202,"<@Beula> so to be clear, `init_app` is a method of a module separate from the main module that runs the init code that I'd usually have in my main module, or...?"
202,"Yeah, it's simply a way to lazily initialize other things that depend on the app object; for example, how I do blueprints: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/blueprints/__init__.py#L7>; And how I do the external dependencies (extensions): <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/external.py#L28>"
202,"Yes, blueprints. I see most Flask-based projects on GitHub use these but I'm not using them _at all_. I think I'm probably missing something here."
202,blueprints help you keep the `app` out of most of your files
202,"yeah, that will cause you issues. But you can do an `init_app` style like this, rather than importing the app directly (which is probably why you have the issue); to get around it temporarily; but blueprints == important"
202,"Ya, even though I don't completely understand it, I feel that I should be implementing blue prints and an app factory pattern asap to avoid even more headaches later on..."
202,"Yeah, they are really helpful"
202,It's annoying that this stuff is buried towards the back of the Flask docs (if I remember correctly) because I'd contend it's almost impossible to build a non-trivial Flask app without it
202,They want people to get the initial wins to like it; Part of why I am not using flask as much is that it encourages crap like this: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/external.py#L39>
202,"<@Gabriele> Ya, it boggles my mind how non-obvious these things are to new users of Flask such as myself. I wasn't even aware these things existed for awhile, never mind that they were at all important."
202,"Unfortunately most blogs and stuff only show happy path projects, few people educate on good patterns"
202,"`from .models`
How does that work? O_o"
202,relative import; <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references>
202,"Ohhh, I see. Being rather new to Python I hadn't seen that before. Didn't exist in any other language I'd been coding in either. I take it that's something to avoid as well? I think I fell victim to at least a few of those tutorials that have some not-so-good practices mixed in with them"
202,"relative imports are okay, but yeah - generally importing in a function/class/method is discouraged"
202,"yeah, relative imports themselves are actually quite good"
202,Do imports by themselves generally have a lot of overhead?
202,relative imports lets you avoid refactor annoyances with renaming packages and such
202,you get to be quite explicit about where you are getting stuff from; in the general case I wouldn’t worry about import overhead
202,"<https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips#Import_Statement_Overhead>; &gt; import statements can be executed just about anywhere. It's often useful to place them inside functions to restrict their visibility and/or reduce initial startup time. Although Python's interpreter is optimized to not import the same module multiple times, repeatedly executing an import statement can seriously affect performance in some circumstances."
202,"I imported some APIs within functions because I thought it was kind of wasteful to import - for example - a Yelp, FourSquare, and EventBrite library when only the TicketMaster library would be needed for a certain call to my API, and after learning you can import in functions in Python."
202,"It actually does have impact that matters; Ideally you'd only do that at app-startup, not each call (e.g. don't import into an http endpoint handler)"
202,"...yeah, I was about to say that. You usually want this sort of thing out of the way at startup time"
202,"Wouldn't the result be the same? I mean, at the risk of sounding like an idiot (this is my first PaaS project), every time someone calls my API doesn't `app.py` - in my Procfile: `web: python app.py` - run again and the whole process starts over?"
202,"no; At least not usually. Python servers, including Flask, are typically long-running processes. They sit waiting for requests, and when they've finished with one, they wait for the next"
202,"you also want to use gunicorn (or a different interface server); don't use the flask devserver for prod; but the way some of those work is as <@Gabriele> said. Some will restart a subprocess after it's handled some number of requests to limit memory growth, or something similar"
202,"Oh no, how do I know if I'm using the devserver on Heroku? It completely slipped my mind and I didn't use gunicorn...so I guess I am? :dizzy_face:"
202,`python app.py` suggests you are
202,Well...yes...I think I am. I guess when I was brand new and just starting the project I somehow thought that Heroku would take of the server stuff...guess that doesn't make much sense.. whoops
202,"It's fine in the short term if you're still developing or have a tiny number of users, but you'll probably want to test in a 'proper' config sooner rather than later to verify that everything still works; For example, we had big problems when we moved our Flask app to Elastic Beanstalk because it has its own particular way that it expects Flask apps to be structured, which didn't match our existing setup"
202,"So - and I still can't believe I didn't already realize this - Heroku runs my project on a server but it's truly a bare server without any HTTP functionality for example, which is why something like gunicorn is needed, right?"
202,they have a load balancer in front
202,"No, it's more that Flask has its own built-in HTTP server that is not designed to run at scale, just to service your local developer requests and that's about it"
202,"So, without the Flask server running, Heroku would take care of that part? :upside_down_face:"
203,thats what you need gunicorn for
202,"no; Without the flask server or gunicorn running, heroku would show an error page"
202,"Go here, scroll down to ""The Web Server"": <https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xviii-deployment-on-the-heroku-cloud>"
202,"so the flow is something liek this

request -&gt; Heroku LB -&gt; Heroku Instance -&gt; Guincorn/wsgi -&gt; Flask/Django; the internal flask http server is not meant for production; its slow, can't scale at all"
202,"<@Gabriele> Haha, I had learned a lot of what I know from that tutorial but hadn't gone through the whole thing. Guess I should've taken time to do the _whole_ thing."
202,thats why you need to have somethign up front to separate into processes and handle concurrent requests
203,i’ve used the factory pattern and blueprints since the beginning with many extensions and never had any issues.
203,Any preferred web hotels to use for hosting django?
203,"Depends on what you want, there is <http://pythonanywhere.com|pythonanywhere.com>, <http://heroku.com|heroku.com> as two _easy_ solutions (infrastructure as a service); I just use Digital Ocean or AWS (usually the former)"
203,DO for personal; AWS for work
202,<@Meg> Wow. That's a super clear explainer! Thanks!; <@Meg> So gunicorn takes care of this process splitting and such?
203,correct
203,"DO for personal but if you are new to AWS you can get a year free of their micro-instances which is really nice.; <https://aws.amazon.com/free/>; &gt; These free tier offers are only available to new AWS customers, and are available for 12 months following your AWS sign-up date. When your 12 month free usage term expires or if your application use exceeds the tiers, you simply pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates (see each service page for full pricing details). Restrictions apply; see offer terms for more details."
203,And is the benefit of using blueprints solely to help with avoiding circular import issues?
203,"if you don’t have a lot of experience with all that stuff I’d say Heroku can be a good first step; as matt said, infrastructure as a service makes things nice and easy"
203,"<@Thomasina> - no, blueprints are just a good way to break up your app into components and separate concerns.; They can help with the import issue since you decorate the route with `@bp.route` instead of `@app.route` though"
203,<@Beula> the breaking up an app into components thing sounds like good OOP really. So blueprints somehow extend this concept?
203,I'd say it's more about general modularity than OOP
203,"Ah, ok; Also, I'm using Flask-restful so I don't have any route decorators, instead `api.add_resource(API_Users, '/users/')` :speak_no_evil: Not sure if that makes a difference in your example, <@Beula>"
203,"I am not familiar with that one, but it looks like they probably build on top of blueprints and you have to register the `api` with your app"
203,"Register the api? Sorry... I'm not sure if I understand. :disappointed: ""Register""? Which `api` might that be?"
203,"Ah, no you use `Api(app)` or `api = Api(); api.init_app(app)`; That is what I was looking for"
203,"```
api = Api(app)

class HelloWorld(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {'hello': 'world'}

api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')
```; api = Api(app) is registering api with app, no?"
203,"Ah, yes, that's right. I guess it's the ""you have to register the `api` with your app""...this is what I'm already doing, right? I'm not sure if it was meant that I need to do this (e.g. I haven't done it) or if it's just being stated that I was required to do this..."
203,"to do this with a blueprint you can do:
```
#extensions.py
api = Api()
```


```
from extensions import api
bp = Blueprint('api', __name__, url_prefix='/api/v1')

api.init_app(bp)

class HelloWorld(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {'hello': 'world'}

api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')
```"
204,"Guys, hi
I have searched for it a little bit, but still dont find information

When I write a custom path in django logging settings like ‘filename’: ‘logs/main.log’ a error occur saying that there is no such file

Am I really should create it manually? Or there is a way it can be done automatically, if no such file exist?"
203,"<@Johana> Oh nice! Thanks for the example! Makes a lot more sense to me now.; So I guess I should dive into learning to implement gunicorn, blueprints, and app factory patterns now. Thanks for the help guys! I can't tell you how much I appreciate it."
203,i haven’t updated this in a while but it’s a good approach to using blueprints and app factory pattern. <https://github.com/mikefromit/real_world_flask>
204,i had many ideas for it initially but it was pushed up mainly to help someone who had a project structure question.
203,"Here is another take, but it's a cookiecutter so slightly less obvious to read: <https://github.com/mrasband/cookiecutter-flask>"
203,mine is slightly based off mattupstates blog article <http://mattupstate.com/blog/how-i-structure-my-flask-applications/>; i asked him tons of questions about his structure in the #pocoo channel on irc.; this was when i was learning flask. i don’t use everything he does.
203,"I guess adding a procfile to either/both would help newbies that use heroku, even if they don't use heroku it at least shows the ""prod command"""
203,flask project structure is interesting and i have found that even my own has evolved over time as i pick up new conventions. i do run several flask apps in production for my organization. one of them runs our biglearn platform and is very similar to the link i posted.; it powers this guy: <https://openstax.org/openstax-tutor>; i don’t mention that to toot my own horn. i just happen to love flask and i want to assure everyone that it can run enterprise level stuff.
204,"<@Ciera> re: github api 

did you find out if you can invite a user to a team if they haven't joined the organization yet?"
203,Yeah it's not possible
204,"<@Noemi> no clue. but I would suggest you have your dev and deployment environments on the same OS; and if you can't, use docker or vagrant to do so; then you would avoid OS-distinct issues like this"
203,<@Noemi> are you running the tests in both instances from the root of the api_tests folder?
204,A possible exception would be Java webapps where you're using Tomcat/Jetty/some other container
204,"<@Junita> yes, root of the directory; Just noticed a hint on the pytest output saying to make sure modules/packages have valid python names. What makes them invalid names?"
203,"I have a set of UI tests structured the same way using pytest and selenium, I don't have this issue with those"
204,"my guess is there’s something different about the environment, which beyond the general wisdom of OS issues would ensure that general setup is the same (python version, dependency versions, etc)"
204,"Hmm alright, I guess I'll have to keep looking into it; Same error when I execute the python file directly without the pytest runner"
204,"to a degree that makes sense, `base` is not in the same directory; test runners will usually do a little magic to make all this work though"
204,"Yeah, the same approach works in my other test suite"
204,"essentially, they’ll add your project root to your `PYTHONPATH`"
204,That shouldn't be something I need to do manually though right?
204,"no it often is taken care of automatically, but I haven’t really used pytest much because I’m a relic and nobody told me that nose wasn’t a thing anymore"
204,<@Junita> well I just spun up a VM with the same OS as our dev server and I am seeing the error there too. Now to figure out what's causing it
204,"yeah I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s an environment configuration issues rather than strictly an OS issue, but that does sort of bring out a strength of something like Docker - not just that the OS is the same but the environment is configured the same; because otherwise yeah, you end up spending time chasing down stuff like this; doesn’t resolve the problem though.  :confused:"
205,Anyone have an idea if there's a way to block the width of the console using Python? I'm currently coding a text-based game and I would like to don't let the user change the sizes of the console/terminal.
204,"<@Junita> okay, so I think PyCharm must doing something to resolve the import paths for me. The code, which also errors out on the command line of the VM I created runs in the PyCharm debugger. When I print out sys.path I see the path I am trying to import from though, so I really don't know..."
204,"ah, yeah, that might do it"
204,"But again, I don't know why the same isn't happening with my other test suite"
204,is the other test suite within the same hierarchy?
204,"Yeah, both on the desktop of my dev box and both in the Jenkins home directory on the dev server; Alright, at pycharm &gt; run &gt; edit configurations if I uncheck Add content roots to PYTHONPATH, it fails from the IDE as well; Now we're getting somewhere; I think..."
204,"Have you tried with `python -m pytest` instead of `pytest`?; That said, with `pytest` you may be better served using fixtures instead of base classes for a few reasons:

1. It doesn't need to be importable
2. It allows you to test the library code and the installed code (depending on how you invoke it)
3. Tests are simpler being functions, IMO"
204,"From the file I was trying to import into, I commented everything out including the import statement, printed out sys.path and ran just that script from the command line with pytest. Sure enough, the directory I was trying to import from was not there, so it looks like if I want to keep using my current method, I need to add it manually; <@Beula> I have not really done much with fixtures before, but in this case it sounds like it could work since currently the only thing I have in my base are some values and a method that generates a key from them using hashlib; Also, you make a good point about functions vs classes; For tests"
204,"<@Detra> has a book about testing with pytest, maybe worth the look.; The way I like to do pytest allows you to test your app without installing it, and after installing it - so you get a pretty nice dev workflow"
204,"I am pretty sure I found the problem, and it comes back to forgetting the shebang since I wrote the code originally on windows...."
206,these kinds of things are why we all try to all at least use posix-compliant systems. one guy here was writing on a Windows machine and the line endings got all messed up
206,"I wish I could chuck mine out the window tbh. The more code I write on Windows, the more I loathe it; :joy::joy::joy::joy: slackbot; :taco: <@Beula> <@Junita> <@Patty> <@Meg>"

209,"Hi folks, I ask yet but I can’t find resolution. Some advice I need. I have script with some export of data which collecting data over API. To work correctly over API I must to get some seurity key over API, that key expires after 2 hours. That script open HTTP server and listen on some address. Because is work as server I have
```while True:
            time.sleep(15)

               collecting data command
                collecting data command````
But after 2 hours I need to start function to collect new API secure key.
How to resolve that ?
I tryed to add variable ```wakeup = time.time()``` and to add in while loop 
```if wakeup - time.time() &gt; 7200:
              api_key()```
but I understand that can’t work on this way. :disappointed:"
209,"<@Tristan>  That last way will work, if you do the expression the right way around; `time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time`; another way is just to wrap your usual requests in a function that will request the new API key and re-request if necessary"
209,"<@Gabriele> How to integrate that in
```while True:
        time.sleep(15)```

The best way is to restart whole script after 2 hours, but I don’t want to use cron.
Do you have some idea ?"
209,wrap that script in another script that re-runs it until it's killed?; and just have the inner script quit out after 2 hours. Although I don't see why you need to restart the script
209,How to integrate ```time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time``` in my while loop ?
209,"How do you think? That tells you how long has passed. When a certain time has passed, you'll want to break out of the loop (if you want to restart the script), or get a new token/key (if you don't)"
209,"sorry I’m newbie in python. Can I add this in while loope whith if, and when certain time has passed to call my function for new key ?"
209,"Before the loop, when you get the token for the first time: `start_time = time.time()`; And in the loop, before each request:
```
if time.time() - start_time &gt;= 7200:
    api_key()
```; You'll probably want a value lower than 7200 anyway, because waiting until the last second means you might get a failed request at the end"
209,"kylotan, thank you."
209,"(also, test it with a number like 60, so you don't have to wait 2 hours to see if it's correct or not!); No problem."
210,"So, configuring a Python app to use gunicorn on Heroku, the docs show `web: gunicorn hello:app` for the example Procfile but doesn't really explain what `hello:app` represents. Is it `&lt;class&gt;:&lt;method&gt;` or something like that?"
209,<@Gabriele> Of course. Thank’s :wink:
210,<@Thomasina> I'm guessing it is probably module:function
209,"<@Gabriele> Do you have some idea ?
I added start_time variable before loop, and added this in loop. My loop now looks:
```while True:
        if time.time() - start_time &gt;= 60:
            get_key()

        time.sleep(15)```
When I start script, after 60 seconds scripts run get_key function what is good, but then on after each 15 second again."
209,"ah, of course. you'll need to reset start_time to time.time whenever you get a new key."
209,"I supposed, but how I can to do that in this if statement ?; <@Gabriele>; Can I only to add again ```start_time = time.time()``` in this if statement ?"
209,yes
209,cool !
209,"you could probably improve the code by setting that time inside the get_key function, so that you don't need it in the if statement"
209,"yes, I thinking about that. Thank you <@Gabriele> I will test !"

211,"Only difference is this is on a new server; Oh...maybe they changed something? Hmm...; I guess not. I tried running it locally rather than on Heroku and it worked as expected.; Running locally it uses `/migrations/`, on Heroku it uses `/app/migrations/` :neutral_face:; Just confirmed it"
211,Environment variables?
211,"<@Suellen> I'm not sure, but checking on Heroku the `app` folder does indeed contain my application and there is no `migrations` folder in it even though the log up there says otherwise.; So if I run the Python scripts while inside bash on the server it works perfectly...weird"
212,I suppose this is one of the reasons why I'd avoid managed PAAS if possible; DO/AWS over Heroku
212,"<@Meg> Well, I'm using Heroku because with lower traffic it's cheaper, and because AWS would take longer to learn and I probably don't have enough time with this project"
212,"true, AWS/DO require you to have a good amount of knowledge/time to learn beforehand; and that's a selling point of heroku"
212,"Ya, I mean, I will use AWS eventually, but when I have the time to learn its ins and outs. Actually I started with AWS but switched to Heroku once I realized the complexity, haha"
212,but don't forget they're built on top of AWS; so you're actually using AWS services through Heroku
212,"I'm surprised they're allowed to make a product with AWS that competes with AWS, but I guess it's because anyone who pays for Heroku pays indirectly for AWS."
212,"correct; and AWS really doesn't care about that; since more customers for Heroku means more services Heroku pays them for; and its a useful service; I think things would be different if heroku were provider-agnostic; eg, pick between Azure, AWS, DO, etc"
212,"Ya, that's true"
213,"So, after reading up I _think_ I kinda get _what_ a blueprint is now, except I don't really understand _why_ one should use blueprints. All the examples seem to show either very abstract things or super simple things that don't seem to benefit from a blueprint as far as I can understand."
213,"I have separate blueprints for standard view routes, for JSON APIs, and for admin and testing APIs. I can quickly turn off the whole admin and testing APIs by commenting out the single line that attaches that blueprint; I can also mount all the routes in one blueprint with a different URL path with just one change"
213,yeah I actually have all of my blueprints feature toggleable by environment variables; and essentially the benefit is modularity
213,"I see. Then, I suppose the difficulty I'm having is in understanding how I can use them in my own project. Hopefully it will become clearer after I learn more about them."
213,"_How_ to use them is very straightforward. The docs show that. _Why_ to use them is trickier, until you have done enough big projects that you start valuing modularity from the start."
213,"Yes, I do value modularity greatly but always felt that the package -&gt; class -&gt; property/method approach was comprehensive enough. Naturally I'm trying to think of something similar to blueprints in any other language but the examples I see for blueprints seem like things that - to me - in any other language could be done just as easily with classes.; And since Python has classes and the like this confuses me."
213,"blueprints aren't a language feature, they're a Flask feature; It's giving you a way to make a Flask app out of smaller sub-apps that you might want to mix and match, or change independently; (assuming we're talking about Flask blueprints and not some other blueprints... just noticed we're not in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>)"
213,"I think an important point is that if you don’t see the need, you don’t need to use them.  It’s worth exploring them to know they’re there, but you’ll know when you need them."
213,"Yes, I meant Flask. ""Sub-apps""? So would you perhaps say that this is a way of building an app, but having different parts of the app actually be different apps, where each one is coded like an individual Flask app, and then everything is ""plugged in"" to each other?"
213,"If everything is working fine without them for you, there’s no need to over-engineer your project."
213,"they're not entirely 'sub-apps' but they are modular parts of a larger app, yes."
213,"<@Junita> If I don't implement them now though, and my Flask API grows in complexity over time, will it be a major headache when the time comes to use blueprints though?"
213,I don’t think so.  I refactored some things into blueprints on a previous app and it really wasn’t that bad.; To the extent it will be a pain it will likely be untangling some of the things that have grown to annoying for you; But with a good test suite refactoring isn’t so bad.  So write good tests.  :slightly_smiling_face:
213,"<@Junita> Ah ok. Thanks. :slightly_smiling_face: Then, would you perhaps be able to give me an example of where blueprints would be very useful? All the examples I see are abstract or purely for example and wouldn't be very helpful in a real-world scenario."
213,"So one example is that as <@Gabriele> and I said, it’s quite easy to “turn on” and “turn off” a blueprint - I literally do it based on the presence of environment variables.; so for example when I launched a product we had an Invite system; which was a blueprint, and we were able to turn on and off the need for invites via a simple environment variable change, no need to rebuild and redeploy.; that’s perhaps a pretty niche example of a concrete use though - I really think the modularity is the real benefit.; Things just are cleaner and easier to work with, reason about, etc. when working with them, in my opinion.   But that’s a bit more subjective"
213,Would that be very different from a simple `if os.environ['INVITE_PAGE'] == 1:` in the code for the endpoint where the page would be though?
213,you'd have to add that for every single endpoint
213,"Oh, good point! (pun intended :wink: )"
213,"Right, as well as any other associated stuff you’ve done."
213,"I'm using Flask-Restful which means that the various methods for endpoints (POST, GET, PATCH, etc.) are grouped into classes. However it does feel a bit messy since that means `/users/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/`, `/users/auth/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/friends/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/friends/requests/` and others all have their own classes (some with similar names...I mean how am I supposed to meaningfully differentiate the first two by name?). I'm wondering if this setup could benefit from blueprints in some way."
213,Maybe.  I only briefly messed with Flask Restful so I’m not too familiar with it.
213,"I'm wondering if anyone even uses Flask-Restful for complex APIs, or if it's generally only used for simple ones.; Gonna use this <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Testing/> and wondering if it's ok to put my testing code within my app's main script, or if it should be in its own script"
214,testing code should be outside the app
213,"So, in its own module then?"
214,i use flask-restplus and from what i understand it is inspired from flask-restful.; I believe using a `class` and inheriting from Resource is a the same pattern.
214,I usually have my tests in a separate directory alongside the package for the main app. But I don't use Flask-Testing or any other extension so I don't know what that recommends.
213,`print(__name__)` would print the name of the current...method?...module?
213,It should be the module. <https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html>
213,So if my primary application script is `app.py` and I have `app = Flask(__name__)` I suppose I'm setting it to `app` then? I'd test but my code is in the middle of a major change so I can't run it.
213,"Yes, unless you're running the app.py file directly"
213,It's best to explicitly replace `__name__` with a string in the Flask initializer
215,"Hi guys! I have launced an aws instance with SES(full access) role, Now how can i send an email to AmazonSES without smtp {username/password} credentials on server. An example in python or any relevant link would be great. Basically i dont want the creds to be on server."
216,"```if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)```
So this should not be in the production code, otherwise it'll run the Flask dev server, right?"
216,"No that is fine, that only runs if you directly call `python file.py`; But if you use gunicorn, `gunicorn file:app` it would not run the devserver"
216,"Ah, ok. gunicorn runs a specific function unlike Python which runs the entire script...I should've noticed that. Thanks!; <@Beula> In <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/> you have `pyslackers.__main__:app` in `Dockerfile` but in `__main__.py` there is no `app` function. Instead `app` is a variable as in `app = create_app(resolve_config(os.getenv('PY_ENV', 'dev')))`. How does that work?"
216,"Gunicorn uses that as the WSGI gateway, it's the ""callable"" for the spec; So `app` is a `Flask` instance, and that is a callable (per how wsgi works)"
216,"Oh, wow. @.@ Every time I think I'm understanding everything there's something new to learn. I'll add WSGI to my list of things to learn more about."
216,you don't have to worry too much about it fortunately - just enough
216,"Oh, really? Good to know. Thanks!; Wow. Ya, I expected it to be quite a bit more complicated. Makes sense!; By the way, you have `from pyslackers import create_app, models` in __main__.py but there is no `pyslackers` module...?"
217,`pyslackers` is the package the whole app is in; `create_app` is from `pyslackers.__init__`; models is another module
217,"<@Beula> Oh ok, that's what I thought but for some reason when I run my app - Broadway - locally with Python I get ""No module named broadway"" from the line `from broadway import create_app`"
216,"I'm thinking maybe this is from running __main__.py directly, and perhaps I need a script to run from the parent folder that acts as the true primary script, but I'm not sure"
217,"yeah, you want `python -m broadway`; the `-m` runs it as a module, executing `__main__.py`; but it sets the PYTHONPATH to be the CWD"
217,"Ah, ok! That worked though. Even though I didn't know better I did think that running `__init__.py` or `__main__.py` directly seemed a bit...off. Haha I'm so thankful for your help and this whole Slack. :slightly_smiling_face:; Are Python devs just more helpful people? Seems like it."
217,"We’re more efficient than other developers, so we have time to be helpful.  :stuck_out_tongue:"
217,I am at a ruby job and avoid it a lot
217,"Haha, while initially I wasn't crazy about Python, the more I learn about it the more I like it, and one of those reasons is that I feel it can be very efficient, to create all kinds of things rather quickly"
217,"I use the `__main__` trick to get around some annoyances with importing, python pathing, etc. Because with that way, gunicorn can pick it up and I keep the top level directory clean; I hate how the top level directory can get so cluttered :smile:"
217,"Ya, the cluttered top level was something that I disliked. Before this I was making apps with Adobe Air and most of the time I'd have a single script in my top level and then have everything else in sub directories which felt really organized. Glad to know how to do this in Python."
217,"I think I may be slightly non-standard in that regard. But since `flask` introduced the CLI, I have been liking this approach.; For aiohttp apps, it made it so I could just have an optional CLI to run the application"
217,flask introduced a CLI?  heh.  here I’ve been making a manage.py entry point for all these years.
217,yea it uses click now.
217,I suppose that makes sense.
217,Oh wait...do I not need `manage.py` for my DB deployment then?
218,you can still have a manage.py.
217,the click cli in flask supports it.; <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/cli/#custom-scripts>
217,it’s funny because I’ve been meaning to go through the Flask docs again because I knew there were probably a ton of things like that which have changed over the years.
217,"It's pretty nice, for example with the `flask-migrate` extension:


```
export FLASK_APP=website/__main__.py
flask db migrate
flask run
```"
217,"So I can use this to make deployment more elegant than having to run `python manage.py db init`, `python manage.py db migrate`, and `python manage.py db upgrade` separately?"
217,yeah I was always writing that stuff myself like a sucker
217,"Yeah, you can make a custom command that does those for you; `db init`, if using flask-migrate, is only a 1 time thing though, just setting up the local config and migrations folder; so neither `db migrate` nor `db init` would be needed during deployment"
217,"Oh, nice. Guess I'm kind of micro-optimizing by wanting to combine the init and migrate into one command as well then. Haha"
217,"I do the upgrade/run at boot each time so it's always up to date for prod ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; but init is one time ever for a project, and migrate creates the migrations; so I don't think you need those often enough, those are developer run manually"
217,"Ah, ok.; Good point; In `__main__.py`, `from broadway import create_app` results in `No module named 'broadway'`... Hmm... It's definitely the right name"
217,how are you running it?
217,`python -m broadway`; From the module's parent directory
217,"and the dirs are:

```
broadway
  - __init__.py
  - __main__.py
```
?"
217,Yep
217,python2 or 3?; delete out your __pycache__ dirs
217,Same error. :thinking_face:
217,"Oh, there is a `__pycache__` at the top level too - do you have an `__init__.py` in the `backend` dir?; That would cause it"
217,"Oh, no but there used to be. It became my Broadway module."
217,"is this pushed somewhere, or a work thing?"
217,I'm working on the company repo which I've cloned. The above image is from the local copy. I'm just trying to run it locally on my own PC
217,"Yeah, I was just hoping to see the code to look for anything funky; hmm; and `pwd` has you in the `backend` directory?"
217,Could such a thing be cause by a circular import error?; Yep
217,"It shouldn't, you'd probably see a circular import related error in my experience; :thinking_face: not sure what to suggest given what I can/can't see; what's main.py look like? just `from broadway import create_app`?; I think it may be the broadway from the `__init__`, try changing the `import broadway.external` to `from . import external`; external looks ok, the init otherwise looks ok and then in `__main__.py` I think the `.external` may be a problem; Usually in this case, I would comment out pretty much everything in __init__ and make sure that imports. Then start re-adding things; I gotta get back to work, I will check back in a bit"
217,"So I commented out lines one by one as you said and found the problem line. It's `app.config.from_object(config)`. The way I have this set up is that I pass in `os.environ['APP_SETTINGS']` which contains the relevant configuration class (e.g. `broadway.config.DevelopmentConfig`), and it's this that's throwing the error. I've tried without `broadway` and without `broadway.` but neither of those are working. Before modulizing this I just used `config.DevelopmentConfig` which worked."
217,"The error is now related to config, not imports?"
217,"No, still the same error, but if I comment out `app.config.from_object(config)` in `__init__.py` I no longer receive any errors"
217,"yeah, sounds like you just need to change how the config is resolved"
217,"Even hard-coding it like `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` produces the same error `no module named 'broadway'` even though `broadway` is not anywhere in the parameter. Again, if I comment out this line, the error disappears. :thinking_face:; `from broadway import config, util` in `models.py` appears to have caused the problem. Specifically `config`."
217,"try relatives for anything other than `__main__`, `from . import config, util`"
217,Guess I spoke too soon. I'm not even sure what's going on now. I'm not sure if the line in `models.py` is relevant at all. I just can't get `app.config.from_object()` to work no matter what I provide it with.
217,Even a raw class?
217,Yep. `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` causes `NameError: name 'config' is not defined`
217,is config imported?; sounds like not
217,"Well, I thought that was the issue, so I tried adding `import config` and now I'm back to the old error `No module named 'broadway'`, referring to `from broadway import create_app, models, util` in `__main__.py`, and if I comment out `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` in `__init__.py` the error no longer occurs."
217,`from . import config` is probably better
217,"Oh, my bad. Yes it's `from . import external, config` in `__init__.py`"
217,"It sounds like you still have a bad import somewhere, something external or config or something like that import"
217,"Changing `from broadway import create_app, models, util` in `__main__.py` to `from . import create_app, models, util` changes the error to `ImportError: cannot import name 'create_app'`"
217,"yeah, because it's trying to import a module, not a function"
217,When should I use `from broadway` vs. `from .`? I didn't know there was a difference actually
217,"you _should_ be able to use `from broadway` everywhere, but I am not sure what is causing you issues ATM. the `.` is a ""relative"" import so it just removes any ambiguity of which package you're talking about; But you can't do relatives in something like `__main__` because the `broadway` package isn't initted yet, or something like that"
219,"hi guys what would b the correct the print out date with letters instead of digits as month using datetime

219,thank u <@Beula> and <@Minerva> !!!
219,I placed some `print()`s at certain points to see if things were actually executing. After running `python -m broadway` I can see...; `created app` prints _after_ `app = create_app(os.environ['APP_SETTINGS'])` runs; Why was there no error at the beginning? Is this behaviour normal?
219,"python executes as it reads; I am kind of dumb, but in this case with flask you can do:  `FLASK_APP=broadway/__main__.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run`; No need for the python -m and such (though that looks like windows, not sure how the flask CLI work sthere); Sorry for sending you on a chase on accident"
219,Oh? Was I on a chase?
219,"No, I meant this whole refactor with the `__main__` and such; It's hard when I can't review the code"
219,o_o
219,is it working?
219,Yep
219,:boom:
219,"I'm happy that it's working, but honestly I'm even more confused than before :upside_down_face:"
219,probably a flask devserver oddity
219,"Well, that never would have occurred to me. I'll have to remember that."
219,sorry man
219,Sorry? You solved my problem! :stuck_out_tongue: Thanks man!
219,after spinning for an hour or so
219,"Haha, no problem. It would've taken me alone at least 6 hours. :wink:; The only - quite odd - problem I'm having now is that all my endpoints are returning 404s. There are no Python errors reported whatsoever though. :thinking_face: I'm not sure what to make of it. I inserted some `print()`s to check everything was running in the order expected and it was."
219,Can you give a sample of how you are registering your blueprints?
219,"Um, no blueprints :sweat_smile:"
219,how are you registering routes
219,"In __main__.py:
```...
from broadway.external import api, auth
app = create_app(os.environ['APP_SETTINGS'])
class API_Root(Resource):
    def get(self):

api.add_resource(API_Root, '/')```; (Just one of many endpoints, but I chose the simplest one); Changing the port number in `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)` has no effect. The server restarts on the default port. :thinking_face:"

227,Could you try to answer me a question please?
227,Yes if it is related to python.
227,<@Chery> <https://mikeash.com/getting_answers.html>
227,"I'm currently learning how to use modules and call other files. It's is possible to have a file named(main.py) and call another file(ship.py). And from ship.py execute a function in main.py Sorry if I'm not explaining clear enough.; From the function main.py I want to execute some code of the file ship.py and also I want to do it the other way, from ship.py I want to execute functions of main.py"
227,"<@Chery> this is called a 'circular import', and that's generally prohibited"
227,Oh
227,"`main.py` sounds like an entry point, why would you import something from it?"
227,I'll search about it
227,"```
# main.py
import ship
ship.some_function()

# ship.py
import main
main.some_other_function()
```"
227,"Yeah malinoff, that was my idea, but at main.py I have a function to create a delay_print and I also want to use it at ship.py"
227,<@Carri> have you tried to run this snippet before posting? :slightly_smiling_face:
227,as long as you don't do `from main import some_other_function` and `from ship import some_function` you won't have circular import issues. Although the import semantics have changed in Py3.x to help prevent circular imports
227,<@Carri>  Like this it gives me an error
227,<@Chery> Restructuring your code would help
227,<@Chery> then move `delay_print` into `ship.py`; And do `from ship import delay_print`
227,"<@Collette> Yeah, that would work, and what about if I put this functions in another file and call them?"
227,"<@Chery> you don't ""call files"" in python. You _import_ things from _modules_ and _packages_; <http://bit.ly/pypackages>"

229,Is any one aware of some API or some other way(free) to retrive DHL's courier tracking details for multiple users (input = user's tracking number) ?
230,"no but i remember when i wrote a fedex client that was SOAP. you may need to checkout their web api and create your own. if they provide a swagger file you may be able to autogenerate a client but that might be a stretch, hehe."
229,<@Johana>  I think this is the link <http://www.dhl.com/en/parcel_ecommerce/integration/integration_channels/api.html> . But I haven't been able to figure out how to use it. I am working on chat bot using Microsoft's chat bot framework for DHL.
230,yep that looks like it; yea if you don’t already see a python-dhl or dhlpy type of project on pypi you will need to write your own but this is good news. you should be able to integrate with dhl nicely with python :wink:; we have lots of web apis at work so i’m always writing clients. their docs seem straightforward too.

231,yeah i dont understand how this code decide on 6; why not 1?; why does it only output one number
231,"Your function returns hcf, which is being overwritten everytime whenver hcf is set to i"
231,because hcf can hold only one number
231,but hcf is a name that we give it
231,yes. try making HCF a list
231,"In first loop hcf is 1, next it gets overwritten with 2, next 3, next 6, hcf variable will continue to hold 6 until the loop hits 24"
231,it will give you all the numbers
231,how? what do you mean; oh!; understood :hugging_face:; :rose: i appreciate it
231,We appreciate :taco: here
231,just declare hcf=[] before the for loop
231,haha interesting i am coincidently listening to spanish music now :taco:; <@Shelly> :taco:+1000000
232,"You would also need to do hcf.append(i), can't just assign to it if you want it to remain a list."
233,spanish music is awesome.
233,"As in from Spain or in Spanish? The former, maybe. The latter, I think it depends."
233,"<@Johana> I'm from Spain, what singers are you talking about?"
233,"latin america wherever.; salsa, merengue, bachata, wutevs."

I'm building a REST API and I've put my source into its own module titled `broadway`. I'm implementing an app factory pattern. In `__main__.py` I have `from broadway import create_app, models, util`, and `create_app` is defined in `__init__.py`. These are the entire contents of `__init__.py`:

After running my app with the Flask CLI it launched without errors. Then the problem was that all the endpoints of my API returned 404s, even though there were no errors in the actual Python reported (Flask's debug mode was on)."
242,`python -m unittest discover`   What this command do?
243,"hi,"
241,":open_mouth: Same. I thought <@Thomasina> was kidding this whole time. Looks like something I'd try, though, TBH."
244,Hi is anyone active ?
244,Does sitting down class as active?
244,That all depends on the class. :slightly_smiling_face:; I have a code challenge that I'm working on from Google.. they give it to you when you do certain searches. It's a recruiting tool to get candidates for interviews.; I've found a few solutions but they don't seem to be scaling up for some reason.; I have to find the largest number that can be divided by 3.
244,"&gt; dont seem to be scaling up
Can you explain?"
244,"They give a number 954311
and the largest number that is divisible is 94311; The length of the number can be up 10 digits long.; Mine works perfectly up to 6 but beyond that I think there is an error; My latest attempt was the fastest to execute but failed 4 of 5 tests. I don't get the error from them so I dont know why it failed.; In other attempts it ran slower (I built a set of permutations) and passed 4 out 5 tests.; Knowing that the number of digits in the list can grow up to 10.. my guess is it's not scaling up properly."
244,Tell me what your code does when the number isnt divisible  by 3; In your own words
244,If the number is not divisible by three it increments down one and checks the next one if that is divisible by three.
244,"Ok. What if the number ""decrement by one"" cant be made with the numbers in the list?"
244,"Let me explain more. 
First I take the list of numbers and I sort them high to low. 
I join the values together, appending one to the other.; So 5,3,4,1,2
becomes 5,4,3,2,1
then 54321; I then iterate down from the 54321 until I find the first number divisible by 3.; then I return that"
244,"Yes. So your list is [5,4,3,2,1] but 54320 wouldnt be possible because 0 isnt in your list"
244,The range gives me the iteratable. At that point the list is gone.
244,Exactly
244,I do see the number increment down and I do get a return result that is divisible by 3.
244,"Ok walk me through the problem in just words and you doing it by hand. Dont use your code. 
; If i give you the list [2,2,2,2,7], what is your process?"
244,"let's use [8,7,2,6,4] as the 2's will hide some steps; so I need to turn that in to 87642; then find the largest number that is equal to or less then that number and is divisible by 3"
244,"Lets use [8,7,3,6,2] since the largest num isnt divisible by 3"
244,That's the point.
244,Exactly
244,It has to be closest to or equal.
244,"So, whats the next number you try?; After 87643 fails, then what?"
244,"my code is stepping down to 87641, then 87640, etc..; checking each for % 3 == 0; AH!"
244,"Ok, is 87642 a valid answer to the problem where the input is [8,7,6,4,3]?"
244,I realize where I made one mistake..; OK the number has to use all numbers in the set..; Let me show you my other approach if you don't mind.
244,&gt; finds the largest number that can be made from some or all of these digits 
244,"In this approach. I take all the numbers in the set and create every permutation from them. Then increment through the new list in descending order.; In this one, I filter the list to remove duplicates.; I also break up the sets by length because I hit a memory limit error on submission. In that case the first hit for 954311 is 94311."
244,Good. Your on the right track. 
244,"l = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]"
244,Large numbers will have a LOT of permutations. So it's probably best to load them lazily rather than making a set
244,it could be a memory error.. they don't specially say..
244,It could also be an issue with string sorting vs number sorting :)
244,when I created one big set for all permutations that's when i got the memory error. but this code runs it just fails test 4 and I get no error
244,You might want to try converting every sting into an int before sorting
244,"That makes sense.; data_set = map(int, data_set) 
should take of that?"
244,"Ya, i think so"
244,thanks i really appreciate you talking me through the problem.; I'm a product manger.. it's been a loooooong time since I had to worry about code challenges. :smile:; I prefer to be explicit in the code but I don't want to look like a Jr. Do you think there is a better approach?
245,"for one it doesn't look like your code handles the condition: `If it is not possible to make such a number, return 0 as the answer`"
244,This code also timed out..
245,"two, i like nhumrich's idea to lazily evaluate, which you could do with generators"
244,Correction.. I'm trying it with iterator on the permutation and that timed out; I think building the list and then sorting it is the problem.; returning 0 is something I missed. I'll try that too
244,<@Madaline> why are you using set in line 10?
244,"what about something like (note: you'd have to re-write to get it to work with a list of numbers as input)
```
from itertools import permutations

def permutation_gen(x):
     for r in sorted([i for i in range(len(str(x)) + 1)], reverse=True):
         for p in permutations([i for i in sorted([i for i in str(x)], reverse=True)], r=r):
             s = sum([int(i) for i in p])
             if s % 3 == 0:
                 yield(int(''.join(p)))

def get_largest_3_modulo(x):
    try:
        y = next(permutation_gen(x))
    except StopIteration:
        y = 0
    return y

get_largest_3_modulo(954311)
```"
244,I had started with a similar approach but their verification tool was not reporting errors properly.
244,"<@Madaline> sorry, didnt see the new one."
244,"code that ran perfectly in my Jupyter was failing.. So split it up and simplified it .; This approach looks much better then what I was doing.; This is what I originally tried but I hit memory errors.; In case anyone is interested in triggering the Google code challenge. I've been spending a lot of time searching for Python, crawlers, NLP, analytics, algorithms, etc... This is the second time it came up for me in the last 2 months.. I  was on vacation last time it came up so time ran out.; <@Cleta> I have a quick question about your example. One line 6 there is SUM of the permutation and then you are checking if it is divisible by 3. Then on line 8 your yield is the joined integer. Is this a faster way or an error?"
246,"any number that is divisible by three has the sum of its digits = to a small multiple of 3, 6, 9, ...
So 33333, if added together equal 15, which in turn equals 6; so I would add all elements of list and see if that sum is % 3"
246,^this
246,Not sure if that fits
246,Thank you.. Its funny. I never really have to deal with this type of problem.
246,"not sure if it is faster than modulo-ing the int, that's just what came to mind"
246,I can time it and see if it helps performance
246,"<@Madaline>, just doing a modulo a la `if int(''.join(p)) % 3 == 0:` is a little faster, i'm guessing because the other way adds a list comprehension step. good catch"
246,Thank you both.. <@Minerva> <@Deedee>.. I think this should unblock me..; Thanks again! Hopefully I can get through the rest and get an interview. :smile:

247,i see. so the sorted() does not really have any effect on this dictionary; <@Shelly> <@Cleta> :taco:

247,yup i got it :slightly_smiling_face:!

248,"good luck. when google hires you, don't forget us little guys :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"
247,"<@Kandis> to elaborate more on <@Shelly> ‘s answer, the function `marks.keys()` returns a list of keys in the dictionary and `sorted()` returns the sorted list. Although why is there a conversion to list when it will return a list anyways?"
247,<@Cleta> mmm good point..; idk either
248,"Good luck,"
247,"interesting to note is that it doesn’t effect your dictionary in any manner, it will return a list of sorted elements anyways. even if you pass a string to `sorted()` function but if you use the `list.sort()` function , it changes the list."

253,you should post the part where you are stuck and I'm sure someone will help you :slightly_smiling_face:
253,"Hi Jason, Thanks and from the link you have mentioned, it says i can use subprocess without `shell=true` by sending the command in list. Opening new console is fine for me and the problem is I cant output the stdout in that new console. Becasue I have to redirect the output to a file and console both on real time."
253,:); Can i post my question on stack overflow?; I mean the link to the question ; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45087325/set-up-a-crawler-and-downloaded-tweets-unable-to-parse-json-file?noredirect=1#comment77166732_45087325>
253,<@Vonnie> Do you have an example JSON file you're having trouble with?
253,Yes I do. It's a twitter json file 
253,"Usually JSON files can be loaded with json.loads(f) and then used as a standard Python data structure (nested arrays and dicts etc); <@Vonnie> Well, attach it then?"
253,Let me turn on my laptop. One minute 
253,"<@Vonnie> Sure, no hurry.; Thanks, I'll try to read it."
253,"When I tried to parse it using other scripts, it would give me (ValueError: Extra data: line 2 column 1 - line 1201 column 1 (char 13339 - 8801096)"
253,"For starters, thats *not* a valid JSON file.; It's more like a text file where every line seems to contain a JSON representation of an object.; ...workin...."
253,Ahh; I had set up a crawler to download scripts ; Sorry ; Tweets I mean ; Is there a way I can fix it?
253,"<@Vonnie> This will work:
```
import json

nr = 0
for line in open(""stream_BhagNawazBhag.json""):
    ob = json.loads(line)
    text = ob.get(""text"", """")
    user = ob.get(""user"")
    if user:
        username = user.get(""name"", """")
    print username
    print text.encode(""utf8"")
    print

    if nr &gt; 10:
        break
    else:
        nr += 1
```; <@Vonnie> Getting data from Twitter is quite something else as parsing that data ;-)"
253,"You should use the context manager for the file open to ensure it's closed, and use the future print function to make sure the code is 3.x compatible"
253,I understand. Sorry for being a noob; Just that I got the data. Wanted to parse it 
253,<@Beula> Thanks for your excellent advice!
253,<@Beula> should I install python 3 then?
253,"<@Ruben> :taco: nice suggestion for the op; <@Vonnie> - Python 3 is the future of the language, so it is worth using. But for now, I wouldn't divert your attention from your current issue"
253,Ahh
253,"<@Vonnie> It depends on what you use now. Do you need any Python 3 features for your work that you can't do in Python 2? Eventually, Python 2 will become obscure indeed."
253,<@Beula> I will keep that in mind 
253,...probably 20 years into the future.... but remember 2000!  Nobody saw _that_ coming.
253,"<@Ruben> for the moment, I just need to finish this "
253,"<@Vonnie> Stick with what you have then ;-) But make a mental note to upgrade, 10 years from now."
253,I will upgrade 2 months from now :)
253,That's great
253,Will try the code 
253,"<@Vonnie> Also, your file should be named *BhagNawazBhag_stream.txt* instead of *stream_BhagNawazBhag.json*, because it is really not a JSON file. It is a text file with a JSON packet on every line. The program which produces this, will cause confusion by naming it with a '.json' extension."
253,Ohhh; I wish i had joined this group earlier ; Had spent countless hours looking for a solution 
253,"<@Vonnie> And this is the code with mattrasband's suggestions applied:
```
from __future__ import print_function
import json

nr = 0
with open(""stream_BhagNawazBhag.json"") as f:
    for line in f:
        ob = json.loads(line)
        text = ob.get(""text"", """")
        user = ob.get(""user"")
        if user:
            username = user.get(""name"", """")
        print(username)
        print(text.encode(""utf8""))
        print()

        if nr &gt; 10:
            break
        else:
            nr += 1
```"
253,let me try it out. Thank you for that. I really appreciate the help.
253,"I agree that the *from future* is quite useful for all of the people who use Python 3 already, but I'm less convinced of the *with open() as f* context manager. I think the file object will be closed anyway when it goes out of scope; the context manager seems to add extra complexity and an extra indentation level. However I _do_ think a file context is useful when writing a file as part of a larger operation, so you can indeed force it to close (and flush to disk)."
253,"I did try python 3 earlier but a lot of the scripts/recipes were written in 2.7, so I had to downgrade"
253,"Uh-uh. I see.; Well, it's not forbidden to use Python 2 ;-); I used it for 25 years and I'm still using it."
253,i understand :slightly_smiling_face: Apologies for being a bit slow here; the script worked
253,Great! And now?
253,i can run that in the command prompt and save the output.; would i be able to edit the code and add some more to it? as in to get other data from it?
253,What is your ultimate goal? To extract the tweets from the file?; Oh yeah sure you could extract anything and everything from it
253,"Basically I just need to make the file easier to read so I can count the number of tweets, retweets, see who tweets the most, and do a word cloud."
253,"<@Vonnie> Ah, you want to do some statistics on the data."
253,Yup. That's what the plan is. I just need to get a better idea of what people are doing and saying
253,"Well, counting the tweets is not hard: that's just the number of tweet objects in your stream file."
253,yeah i mean that was just the easiest part :slightly_smiling_face:; there was another script which had the functions i needed but it gave me the same error
253,"Counting the number of retweets is somewhat harder, is that mentioned in the Tweet object? If so, you could fetch it and do something with it. Retweets always belong to one specific tweet, no?"
253,well i could skip that. just would prefer to see who the most prolific ones are
253,"You mean, you are only interested in tweets that get a lot of retweets?"
253,"well i am analysing twitter trends. have four big files. want to see who tweets the most, which ones got the most RTs, geotag them, and make a word cloud."
253,"Why do you have 4 big files, and not 2 or 6 or 35?"
253,the script i followed didn't give me the option to make smaller ones; so basically i collected a lot of tweets for trends; the four files are for four trends
253,"Ah, every trend gets its own stream file!"
253,yes; and those files are around 1 gb to 1.5 gb each
253,"*who tweets the most* -&gt; Every tweet has a 'user' object, and in there is a 'name' attribute with the name of the user who made the tweet. You could use a dictionary to store all usernames and the tweet count. You know, going from the beginning to the end of the tweets and storing the username in a dict, or incrementing the tweet count if the user is already in the dict.; The when the counting is done, you could convert the dict to a list of (name, tweetcount) tuples and sort that on decreasing tweetcount. Then print out the first 10 items of the result and you have a TOP 10 of most prolific tweeters.; Or is it twitterers?; :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"
253,Either name works :)
253,<@Vonnie> Dont worry about the file size because the construction 'for line in f: ...' doesn't load the entire file into memory.
253,Ahh; So no need to iterate ; Would I be too lazy if I asked someone here how I can do that? 
253,"<@Vonnie> For example, to show the Twitter users with the most tweets:
```
import json
import collections

twitterers = collections.defaultdict(int)

with open(""stream_BhagNawazBhag.json"") as f:
    for line in f:
        ob = json.loads(line)
        # text = ob.get(""text"", """")
        user = ob.get(""user"")
        if user:
            username = user.get(""name"", """")
        if username:
            twitterers[username] += 1

print ""Most prolific twitterers (or tweeters? Twitter users?)""

for k, v in sorted(twitterers.iteritems(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True):
    msg = u""%s - %d tweets"" % (k, v)
    print msg.encode(""utf8"")
    if v &lt; 6:
        break # We're not interested in people with less than 6 tweets

''' Will output:

Most prolific twitterers (or tweeters? Twitter users?)
KhalidMunawarPTI - 29 tweets
Adger Alam - 15 tweets
Mamma Mia - 12 tweets
Kashif Mughal 🇵🇰 - 12 tweets
zain ali - 9 tweets
Nuzhat Khan - 9 tweets
lubna - 9 tweets
Fahid Gill - 8 tweets
PeacefulBalochistan - 8 tweets
ⱲᎪႭᴀᏚ ҚᏂᎪⴖ 🇵🇰 - 7 tweets
Osman Kasim - 7 tweets
Maida Farid - 7 tweets
balochi - 7 tweets
Farrukh Hasan - 6 tweets
Pervez  esabzai - 6 tweets
Ali Irfan - 6 tweets
PM - Imran Khan - 5 tweets
'''

```"
253,Wow; That's really good ; I need to sit down and work on my python skills after September 
253,"<@Vonnie> Yeah it really pays to know the data structures and the common idioms.; I am sure my code can be made even better.; Do you see a bug there? `not interested in people with less than 6 tweets` still, I see a line which says `PM - Imran Khan - 5 tweets`. How do you think that could be prevented?"
253,Maybe not include RTs ; It probably has included RTs 
253,"No, I don't do anything with retweets in the code above."
253,Maybe I can let that slide ; Will just truncate the rest 
253,"The solution is to test _before_ outputting something, like:
```
for k, v in sorted(...):
    if v &lt; 6:
        break # We're not interested in people with less than 6 tweets
    msg = u""%s - %d tweets"" % (k, v)
    print msg
```

instead of:

```
for k, v in sorted(...):
    msg = u""%s - %d tweets"" % (k, v)
    print msg
    if v &lt; 6:
        break # We're not interested in people with less than 6 tweets
```"
253,Ahh
253,You know what the `break` statement does?
253,Terminate 
253,Terminate what? The whole program?
253,Inside the loop 
253,Correct! The break terminates the loop in which it is placed
253,Glad I remember some of my stuff ; Will try this out 
253,Another nice question. What's the difference between a *class* and an *instance* ? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
253,A class consists of objects etc ; And an instance is an object 
253,"I agree that an instance is an object, but not that a class 'consists of' objects."
254,A template?
253,"Mjah not bad. A *class* is indeed a kind of definition which says what data exists and what methods (functions) there are to operate on it. However, having a *Person* class doesn't give you actual persons. You'd have to _instantiate_ some Person objects and give them names, ages, etc...; And in Python, as well as Swift, we can instantiate objects by calling the class as if it were a function. `fred = Person()` will instantiate an instance of the class Person and have `fred` reference it. In Javascript you have to use `new` to create a new instance of a class.; In Ruby too!"
253,Ahh
253,So you like learning Python?
253,I found it more interesting than other languages ; Need to learn so I can be better ; I can analyse data ; Usually use r ; In this case need to use python 
253,"Oh, I never tried 'R'. I was charmed by Python many years ago because of its great data structures and ease of manipulating them. Nowadays I'm also looking into JavaScript (it has become lots better lately) and Clojure and ClojureScript (LISP always fascinated me, so expressive and succinct!)."
253,That's why am using python here ; Easier to just get what I need.
253,"The JavaScript community has even invented *coffeescript* which is a kind of JavaScript but without all the brackets and syntax burden! It uses indentation for blocks of code, just like Python does. Same goes for CSS languages like Less and Sass, and template languages like Jade and Pug."
253,"Need to research it ; As u mentioned earlier, it wasn't really a json file ; Just wanted it to be readable so I can analyse it properly "
253,"I agree that it should be text-only (not binary!) so you can inspect it in an editor; But serialized JSON, everything on one line, is just as useful as XML ;-)"
253,Haha 
253,I use *pprint.pprint(obj)* to print out objects nicely
253,Here's the thing. I am working on a paper for my dissertation ; My supervisor said that I won't be judged for code ; Just the analysis as it's about  social media ; So that's why I know it's not unethical to ask 
253,"I helped some PhD's in the past, (for free), maybe I can help you too?"
253,I would appreciate it. Lost a lot of time as my father was ailing from cancer and lost his battle a month ago 
253,I'm so sorry to hear that. It happened to my grandparents.; <@Vonnie> Another PhD I helped was about <https://github.com/motoom/farasabina>
253,Sorry to hear that 
253,"I could help you with the hard programming parts of the data analysis of your dissertation, and the only compensation I ask for is that I can open-source the software on GitHub as a showcase.; Would you be fine with that?"
253,That would be great. I would appreciate it ; Code being open source helps ; Would it be OK after I get my grade?
253,"<@Vonnie> My email is <mailto:motoom@xs4all.nl|motoom@xs4all.nl> - and I'm glad you agree with me that Open Source is great. It's all for the advancement of Science, no? It is so important that peer reviewers can inspect every step in the scientific process."
253,Indeed ; Learning should be for everyone 
253,Open-sourcing your data and methodogies fit in that pattern.
253,Yes will help others 
253,"Now, Science and Art... I've also done Art projects (for free!) like <https://github.com/luismqueral/jumpcityrecords> for which I did all the programming"
253,Let me check 
253,<@Vonnie> I think this is the correct SoundCloud URL: <https://soundcloud.com/jumpcityrecords>
253,That's quite cool
253,"Too bad Luis is not active on the project anymore, but, interests shift and people move to other things."
253,True 
253,At least there is a history of music that was produced by the project :grinning:
253,That's the best part 
253,"Yes, the Internet (Web?) never forgets things."
253,Yeah u can't delete it 
253,Some people try it: <http://lifehacker.com/5958801/how-to-commit-internet-suicide-and-disappear-from-the-web-forever>
253,Things last ; Even embarrassing tweets 
253,"And why can&amp;#39;t they get their single quotes correct?; *Especially* embarrassing tweets, LOL"
253,Yeah that's what makes me laugh ; My main aim was to understand troll like behaviour ; My supervisor said it was too ambitious and I needed to stick with something on a smaller scale 
253,But how would you detect 'troll behaviour'?
253,Yeah that's why he said it was too ambitious :)
253,But do you have an idea what makes a 'twitter troll'?
253,So I suggested I crawl four trends ; A person who harasses others and is vile. ; So I crawled them 
253,"I agree, but how do you deduce that from the text of the tweets? You looking for certain troll-words?"
253,Yes and that's why I want to do a word cloud ; Here's what I did 
253,"Ah, I see."
253,I knew which trends to follow ; Two of them in favour of the govt ; They are a bunch of paid trolls ; Other trends were full of hatred ; My hypothesis is that the same people are taking part in those trends 
253,"Interesting! You begin with a hypothesis, and do work to prove of disprove it. That's the scientific method, isn't it?; ...and are you also capable of making predictions after analysis of all teh data?; Like, what people are likely to be trolls? What behaviour is indicative of trolls?"
253,"Yes that's the idea ; Well that's why I am going for something simpler ; To detect patterns ; If I have time I can do a sentiment analysis but that would be overkill ; As I am balancing exam preparation and work on the project. Had to defer it because I had to be there to take care of my father ; Ps before they complain, I would move this discussion to private. Too many lines of text here "
253,That is OK. How do we do that?
253,Well maybe communicate via dm here?; Alternatively email is also good 
253,(Discussion moved to private channel)
253,Any idea to implement array and their operations without using numpy 
253,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html>? what are you trying to do and why not numpy?
255,"Hello. Does anyone know host django in aws ec2 problem?; I change the allow_hosts in setting, but doesnt work; Really appreciate if some one can help me.; Because I took 2 days still can not figure out what problem."
255,<@Alvina> give this a shot <https://dryan.com/articles/elb-django-allowed-hosts/>; you may also have to add `.<http://elasticbeanstalk.com|elasticbeanstalk.com>` to your ALLOWED_HOSTS
255,Thank you <@Marcie>; I will try; lol......It works. Thank you so much <@Marcie>; You save my life
255,:toot:
255,"Sorry, I have one more problem, in django, connect to aws, when ‘eb open’, shows Internal server error, 500 error in browser. Does anyone know how to solve it. I google it, but it still can not solve my problem."
256,Hey everyone.; I've a Django interview coming up in about 8 hours.; Any tips on what I should be looking at? I've only a few months experience with it.
255,"<@Alvina> that usually means there's some sort of issue with the ELB hitting the health endpoint, make sure your ELB health checks are able to hit your server and check your server logs"
256,"<@Hattie> get as much sleep as possible, maybe play around a bit with some Test Driven Development for django"
256,"I'm at work, lol; I had a good 5 hours of sleep.; Its 10AM here and the interview is at 6PM"
256,"ahh; that's not too bad i guess; if it's a junior position, try and focus on what you've learned in your months with django, try and identify what you're doing well and what you're excited to learn next; ensure you know how testing frameworks interact with django, ensure you know how to write some tests, maybe go over the model and filtering examples again so you're aware of filter chaining and foreign key relationships"
257,"`/reports/&lt;lat&gt;/&lt;long&gt;/` vs. `/reports/?lat=x&amp;long=y`
What do you guys think? :slightly_smiling_face:"
256,Got you. Thanks <@Marcie>
257,"<@Thomasina> first one; there are always gonna be `lat` and `long` params, and this way it looks pretty"
258,"hi I have a doubt what is the difference between json.loads(b’byte_string_from_outside’) and b’byte_string_from_outside’.decode(‘utf-8’) because I read docs and experiment a little bit but is confusing because but seem to work, which one should  go ?"
258,The former will return a `dict` representation of the JSON. The latter just returns a `str`.
258,"in the first case may be returned any type that can be represented in json, not only dict; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; json.loads('42')
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; json.loads('[1,2,3]')
[1, 2, 3]
```"
257,"<@Thomasina>, have to disagee with <@Suellen>. The second would be my preference; especially with a rest api resource, wince `report` is a verb, and defines a resource; `lat` and `long` are attributes for that resource; but I would suggest definining what the requirements for `report` is... eg `location`; `/report/location?lat=&lt;lat&gt;&amp;long=&lt;long&gt;`"
257,looks awful %)
257,"so this is better? `/report/90.49283/-56.934`?; that doesn't make any sense,"
257,why?; it's the same thing
257,"looking at it, it has no context at all"
257,"and why do you need context while looking at the URL?; `?`, `=` and `&amp;` have almost no place in 2017"
257,oh bull; they absolutely do
257,"As a user, it's more confusing to see `?`, `=` and `&amp;`, then just `/`; why do my URLs have to look like that?"
257,"so, I fail to see how the first makes more sense; location with two numbers in slashes; what are those numbers?"
257,Let's see how FB does it: `<https://www.facebook.com/notes/equine-calculator/how-to-claim-your-vanity-url-for-your-facebook-page/474147772600069/>`; `<https://www.facebook.com/help/121237621291199>`; Not `<http://facebook.com/?action=help&amp;id=1212376|facebook.com/?action=help&amp;id=1212376>...`
257,doesnt apply here exactly; because `/help` is just one resource that takes in one parameter; `/report/number/number` is pretty crappy design
257,"no, that's way too technical of an explanation"
257,doesn't tell me anything abut what `report` is to take; <http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#advanced-queries>
257,once you visit literally one report page you'll know exactly how to use it
257,and then looking through a list of URL endpoints; where `report` can have multiple filters
257,&gt; An API is the user interface for a developer; you kinda forgot about the users here; doing things by the book will only make other developers pat you on the back
257,so?; `/reports` is a good identifier; leaving everything else after that in slashes is crappy design; especially when the purpose is to _filter_
257,so what happens if a person DOES implement it that way?; what's the penalty for crappy design
257,give someone else the project
257,developers are angry and users are a tiny bit less confused %)
257,with crappy URL structure; then you get a high WTF count and swear plenty at the idiot who came up with the URLs :slightly_smiling_face:
257,but no complaints from users?
257,users don't give a shit
257,I could theoretically recite this URL to my mum over the phone; the one with `?stuff=thing&amp;other=dunno`? not so much
257,"thing about this, you can do what you want; there's just convention, not hard rules; your method to me, is confusing; as a developer and a user; because all it does is tell me this is a report link; with some numbers; nothing about _what_ those numbers are and do"
257,"you are trying to know what an URL is before visiting it; just open the page and it will be clear as day, you'll never forget those two numbers"
257,never forget two eight digit numbers?  got photographic memory? :slightly_smiling_face:; so your argument is that its easier to describe over the phone; where theres no copying and pasting involved; and that you're willing to accept the consequences of developer confusion and bad practices for that
257,"Just to add my $0.02; I also prefer the explicit lat/lng arguments, and dislike having things in the main URI path if they don't follow some sort of hierarchy; It does make the URIs a bit uglier but I don't think that matters in this context"
259,:cry:
260,Where can I import `MatchObject` from?; for re
261,"+1 on using query parameters. in addition to what was mentioned, doing `/lat/lon` also makes it more confusing as it makes it appear to be a parent/child relationship almost. the other form makes for sense for say, a user photo, where you end up with `/user/123456/photos/1241241`"
262,"Thank you all for the input! I really appreciate it. I will be implementing lat/long as query params. On a side note, with SQLAlchemy, what would be the best data type for storing a lat or long? I was going to use a float but I'm not sure if that's overkill."
260,"float, with `asdecimal=True`"
262,"<@Meg> Oh, I was weighing the pros and cons of float vs. decimal. With `asdecimal=True` does this mean I'm using a decimal, or is this some kind of float/decimal hybrid?"
260,"<http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/type_basics.html#sqlalchemy.types.Float>; &gt;&gt;&gt;Type representing floating point types, such as FLOAT or REAL.

This type returns Python float objects by default, unless the Float.asdecimal flag is set to True, in which case they are coerced to decimal.Decimal objects."
262,"Ah, ok, I got it. Thanks!! Is your recommendation of decimal due to its accuracy?"
260,"no; you're storing coordinates; so you need something with that ability; specifically, store decimal numbers; <https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric>"
260,"Not wanting to throw an extra complication into the mix, but if you're doing a lot of geographical work, you might want to be using something like PostGIS and doing spatial queries on the DB; (Also, yes, float isn't quite high-precision enough for most lat/long values that we work with, but only just)"
262,"<@Gabriele> Oh wow! I was doing all the geo stuff from scratch, not realizing there could be something like PostGIS! I was still figuring out an efficient method for finding records with locations within a certain distance of a specific lat/long, but I guess PostGIS can already do that."
260,"you need to use postgres for it, though; if that's not part of your stack..."
260,see also <https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
260,"Yep, I'm currently using Postgres"
260,1
260,<@Gabriele> Thanks for the link! This is so much better than building my own system from scratch.
260,no problem
260,Always check what already exist ;) 
262,"<@Ciera> Yep, not sure why it didn't even occur to me. I gotta make that my motto. :joy:"
260,"yeah, good idea; ""is there anything already done for this?"" is a good question to ask; saves _a lot_ of work"
262,"<@Thomasina> you should also consider limiting the precision of your lat/lng coordinates to something like `decimal(9, 6)`.  More precision than that often leads to misrepresented accuracy.  6 decimal places is accurate to about 4 inches..."
262,"<@Willena> Oh, good point. Thanks! :smile:"
263,why cant i  get the absolute value of the number i input based on this code?
263,"<@Kandis> you are calling the function from inside it, but after `return`; So, the function has already run"
263,Input always returns a string I believe 
263,"both <@Patty> and <@Ciera> are right, note if you are using python2 you need to use the `raw_input` function"
263,python 3
263,"Also, you need to have `x()` take an argument that is passed in"
263,"Yeah, looks like the indentation is off for that print"
263,like this?
263,"Yep, now convert the `num` to an `int`"
263,<@Beula> woah it worked. what do we need to convert it to an int; i did this: num=int(input(‘enter a number: ‘))
263,"That'll do :slightly_smiling_face: Of course, test inserting a string instead :wink:"
263,woahhh so cool. thanks very much!
263,No problem!
263,<@Beula> <@Patty> <@Ciera> :taco:; haha!
264,Everybody gets :taco: :smile:
264,"<@Shelly> Fact: I have never eaten, nor even seen, a taco.; I think I'm a freak!"
264,I have never eaten a real taco but I had once prepared at my place. Do not ask me how it tasted. :smile:
264,"Oh, glad I'm not completely alone then. I must say though I'm awfully curious to try one though. I'm pretty sure there's a place within walking distance of here that sells tacos. I may just have to check them out."
264,:yum:
264,I've seen plenty of tacos in various commercials and whatnot and to be frank they do look appetizing.
264,"interesting; I prefer burritos over tacos, tbh"
264,<@Thomasina> tacos are a perfect street food.
264,especially after an afternoon on the bike
264,corn tortillas or nothing :smile:
264,"rice, beans and meat are a perfect combo to recover"
265,"hi anybody here use rabbitmq can give me any tips on how to make it faster ? 
Im using the client and server as here in the docs <https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-python.html>"
264,I’m asking your help because I’m in a little rush is for tommorrow my work
264,Imagining having a taco outdoors after a nice bike ride...ah now I'm hungry!
266,"Hello, I'm in need of some help. I can't figure out why my if statement in the while loop keeps evaluating to True and not breaking out of the loop. <https://pastebin.com/5dCYKRMP>"
264,<@Coretta> what is slow about it?; and what are you trying to get to in terms of speed?; rabbitmq is already very fast
264,<@Patty> something between the answer and the response I’m getting above 2 second time; so yeah Im wonder what Im doing wrong; :disappointed:
264,Is this specifically with the part of the tutorial?
264,I use the same code of the tutorial just change the finnocci funtion for a bot; that i have; I only want liitle tips like what is faster no_ack=True or no_ack=False; how to config the options
264,"it’s faster without acking, and with prefetching generally"
264,I’d recommend to choose no_ack not by speed but by your use case
264,also is the function on the bot is running taking that long time? or is that from after the function is completely to sending back to the response? that should only be milliseconds
266,what cant i return i
266,"What does it return right now?; BTW, you can simplify that:  `smaller = min(x, y)` :smile:"
264,the specific ‘i’ i wanna get in that range
264,"you can return from within the `for` if you want, no reason to keep iterating (otherwise you will *always* get the last `i` value)"
266,mhm? can i return i ?; want do you mean ha!
266,"```
for i in range(10):
    if i == 6:
        return i
```; Instead of waiting to return after the loop"
264,but the problem of my code is not this; i couldnt get output with the code i pasted; oh i got 24 but its the wrong answer.; it should be 6; after i changed the thing i return to this:; then it worked and got 6
266,i dont understand why
264,<@Shelly>
264,"because in Python variables are scoped for the function in this case. So `i` keeps getting re-assigned as it loops over the `range`; If you want to use the `i` without an intermediate variable, either return the `i` directly (as I demonstrated), or use the `break` statement"
264,<@Beula>  what is the code look like when you return the i directly
264,Basically drop in my code snippet!; Those should be equivalent
264,"i appreciate it but they dont work; i got this:; if x % i == 0 and y % i == 0:
                                ^
TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation"
264,<@Kandis> Did you mix spaces and tabs?
264,I assume she copied my snippet
264,"Oh sorry, just caught that"
264,"Looks like what you posed used tabs <@Kandis>  - the python standard is to use 4 spaces instead; So my stuff is configured different, if you re-do the indentation to match that visually, you will be good"
264,yea i copied and pasted; oh
264,"if you're using ipython, just do `%paste`"
264,Is it the standard? :open_mouth: I've been using tabs from day 1.
264,<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces>; PEP8 my friend :smile:
264,i am using pycharm <@Meg>; and me too ive been using tabs and nothing wrong yet
264,"Oh, shoot! My bad. Although I'm curious why spaces are the standard. I think it seems so much easier to press tab once for every indent than space four times for every indent."
264,omg i still get this: IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level; my 4 spaces is the same as 1 tab
264,<@Kandis> You're trying to convert <@Beula>'s snippet from spaces to tabs?
264,ah yes; well idk i tried both spaces and tabs
264,<@Thomasina> - you should make your editor insert 4 spaces when the tab key is hit. You don't literally type `&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;...`
264,:thinking_face:
264,1s <@Kandis> - let me convert it
264,"<@Beula> Oh... I didn't even know that was possible as I've only ever used tabs. Good point. :joy:; Oh sorry, you were converting it? Whoops... :cold_sweat:"
264,<@Thomasina> :taco:
264,"tabs vs. spaces. I am a spaces person, but I can see why tabs would be better."
266,"<@Beula> Haha, thanks! :fork_and_knife:"
264,queue clip from silicon valley!; <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI>
264,I'm definitely going to read through this PEP 8 style guide. It'll take awhile but I think it'd be a good idea. Thanks for the link!
264,79 characters might be the only think that should'nt be followed
264,"yes, but this is serious business! S.V. was lampooning these hair-splitty topics in programming. But to me tabs just bork up my whole work flow."
264,this one gets the wrong answer <@Beula>; well both of them get wrong answer as in 1; and it should be 6; :thinking_face:
264,"<@Kandis> can you repost the problem statement? I scrolled up looking for it, and I was unable to fnd it"
264,"Technically, any int mod 1 is 0; So it's kind of right; You probably want `range(2, ...)`"
264,"You should start at 2; Because of that; …I saw that edit, Matt :wink:"
264,which edit?
264,"<@Beula> Wow! In that clip, unless they're writing Python the girl is obviously wrong from a totally measurable and scientific point of view that is not at all biased by my extreme preference for tabs."
264,I don't see any ` (edited)`!?
264,<@Levi>
264,"Oh nevermind, you just beat me, again"
264,"haha <@Thomasina> - the compiler takes care of them in any language pretty much; <@Kandis> - They are asking for the actual ""problem"" that code is meant to solve, is there accompanying text?"
264,oh is to get the HCF — highest common factor
264,HCF = Highest Common Factor?
264,yes
264,"<@Beula> Sure, but code that written with spaces...it's just...so unnatural. I mean, spaces are wrong because reasons! :joy: It's funny how I can get so worked up over something like that..."
264,":smile:; That's one pro about Golang, they have the `go fmt` tool, that forces tabs. The con is that it's tabs :wink:"
264,what happens in x=y on input?; num1 = num2 ?; n.m. I am looking at 20 windows at the same time here
264,:astonished:
264,"forgive me if I am wrong, but if you are looking for highest shouldn't you set your loop down the integers, rather than loop up?"
264,"Oh, maybe that is what I missed in the original intention - I thought it was the LCF"
264,"yes, they ask for HCF, not LCF; this is what I always told my students: read the question carefully - at least half of wrong answers are because the question was not properly parsed"
264,6 is indeed the highest no?
264,"Sorry <@Kandis> - my bad; Yes, <@Levi> is right - it's best to walk DOWN instead of up this one"
264,<@Kandis> : no idea! :smile: your code should give you the right answer :smile:
264,yea the standard answer i saw is:; it indeed gets the right answer for num1 and num2's HCF which is 6
264,"I think that this loop will work, but it might be suboptimal for large numbers.; but that is a topic for discussion; because you have no way of softcoding a break point in the if-then clause. Whereas if you start high you can jump out as soon as the clause is fulfilled"
264,may i ask how did you determine when to loop up or down
264,"it just ""made sense"""
267,can't explain how
264,"If you want it a little more terse, combining what I had earlier and what you have:

```
def compute_hcf(x, y):
    smaller = min(x, y)
    for i in range(1, smaller + 1):
        if x % 1 == 0 and y % i == 0:
            hcf = i
    return hcf
```

But this can be simplified even more going backwards instead of brute forcing it:

```
def compute_hcf(x, y):
    smaller = min(x, y)
    for i in range(smaller + 1, 1, -1):
        if x % 1 == 0 and y % i == 0:
            return i
    return 1
```"
264,"yes, version 2 is better"
264,"The _when_ is usually a trade-off of how many operations are required until I meet my condition. So when stepping up, you *have to* evaluate every number in the range for the condition. However if you step down, the *first found* number is the answer"
264,simplification means reducing the time complexity. Because those two snippets contain basically identical code structures.
264,"So for v1 above: your complexity is `O(n)` (or that for the size of the range, every number must be evaluated)"
264,"it is always `O(n)` in version one, where v. 2 is `O(n)` in the worst case"
264,"But for v2 the complexity could be at the best case `O(1)` (for any size of the range, only 1 operation is needed) and at the worst case `O(n)`"
264,hehe
264,Does that make sense <@Kandis> ?
264,"woo well explained <@Beula> may i ask if we can leave out the last “-1” in the second version’s range ( for i in range(smaller + 1, 1, -1):); shouldnt it count down one by one already by default"
264,<@Kandis> I think the best way to do these things is to experiment. You get intuition that way.
264,<@Beula> <@Levi> :taco:
267,thanks teachers
264,Here's a link for your reading :smile: : <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range>
264,"it's a bit like math: a technical skill rather than a pure talent. That is, until you get to the higher levels. But looping limits, aligning indices, all that painful stuff has to be done a few dozen times before you stop thinking about it."
264,<@Kandis> You should also checkout Asymptotic Notations and complexity.
264,great point. This is a fundamental theme in programming
264,<@Levi> so deep!!haha thanks
268,help me setting elasticsearch-dsl for n-gram!
269,done!
270,"hi, all! I have dict with oldstring as key and newstring as value. I need replace strings in file according to that dict. What is the best way to do that?"
270,What have you tried <@Fleta> ?
270,"<@Beula> Well, I think to do it like this:
```
for key, value in dict.items():
    with open(filename, 'r+'):
        for line in f:
            line = re.sub(key,value, line)
            f.write(line) # &lt;-- possible mistake
     f.close()
```"
270,Does that work?; you could probably simplify it a little for yourself if you can fit the whole file in memory and then re-write it
270,I thought there is more simple way...
270,"Also, if you use `with open` it handles closing the file for you. For those newer pythonistas, these are called context managers and are awesome"
270,<@Patty> cool)
270,"Yeah, the simplest:

```
with open(my_file) as f:
    content = f.read()

for k, v in dict.items():
    content = re.sub(k, v, content)

with open(my_file, 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)
```

Though there probably is a ""better"" way."
270,"<@Beula> oh! that's really simple) thanks a lot, forget that it's possible to replace in the whole text not just in line"
270,"It saves a few iterations, but it will load the whole file in - so be aware of how large the file is!"
270,"Oh, it's just hundreds of lines, it will be ok."
270,"You can make rabbitmq faster by using the HiPe compile. But I doubt that's the problem, as you wont notice a difference there until you hit scale."
271,so has anyone tried to setup travis with a public python repository that has a private repository as a dependency? From what I can tell I need to have a private travis accnt to even do this =(.
271,well it make sense
271,this wouldn’t be an issue except that my org has run out of private repos.; i think if i used a dependency link in my setup.py with the env_var of a user token that has access and format the dependency link url with the token it should be able to pull the dependency down.; a lil hacky.
271,well if the repo is public people would have access; not sure if that's ok for you
271,not with the env var
271,oh sorry I miss env var; yeah it could work
271,"yea, i’ll have to create a new user and give them read access but it sounds feasible. something for the morning!; ok, i found a good resource. i think this will do the trick. <https://github.com/blog/1270-easier-builds-and-deployments-using-git-over-https-and-oauth>"
272,I'd guess you can just use an ssh key with access to the repo
271,<@Beula> travis isn’t letting me put in an ssh key.; it shows me where i can in the docs but it looks like that’s the spot for a travis pro account.
271,"Oh yeah I'm thinking of your hack, make it an envvar, echo it to a file and then clone ; Travis is pricey"
271,oh ok.
271,Maybe make a basic auth user and use https ; Then in the before process stripe in the creds 
271,yea i found this too. i think you commented @nerdwaller. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4830856/is-it-possible-to-use-pip-to-install-a-package-from-a-private-github-repository#comment55105837_27901245>
271,And it's too late to edit to fix the error; <@Tyrell> please don't cross post ; Give the question in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> some time before broadening the ask
271,"Okey, I will delete one. Should I delete in Django or here?"
271,"If it's Django specific, I'd leave the question there. If you don't get any traction within a few hours, then you can share the question here (note the share tip, per the intro doc, vs copy/paste).; In case you need the intro doc :point_up::skin-tone-4: "
271,"Okey, so in the future I will post my question in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> at first. After some time without response I will paste it here. Is it a good habit?"
271,:thumbsup:
273,Thanks for quick intro.

274,"Hmmm... I have a list of dictionaries that I need to merge but sum one of the keys. Need some direction. My Monday brain is not working efficiently.
Something like this
```
# start with
[
    {'first': 'Frank', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 2},
    {'first': 'Jane', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 3},
    {'first': 'Frank', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 2}
]

# end with
[
    {'first': 'Frank', 'val': 24, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 2},
    {'first': 'Jane', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 3}
]
```"
274,<@Kiersten> - is the merge based on the `id` field (or a grouping of the values)? Also does order matter?
274,"order does not matter, i just need to sum the ""val"", every other piece of data is the same, the id will always be the same; so yes, on the `id` field; With my real data, I am merging on a unique string code"
274,"I would probably use a dict if the dataset is small enough:

```
cache = {}
for item in my_list:
    if item['id'] not in cache.keys():
        cache[item['id']] = item
    else:
        cache[item['id']]['val'] += item['val']
```"
274,"That complicates things later on when I split the list in two by a column value of True/False, but I suppose I can work around that.
Thanks for taking a look <@Beula> :taco:"
274,"Yeah it's a little awkward, but at the end I meant to print `cache.values()` "
274,"<@Beula> Right of course... it's been a long day for me too.
That works great, when the data gets too large I'll adjust as necessary."
274,"Good call on not pre-optimizing too much! I am sure there is some really terse and cool trick, but I like simple :smile:"
275,Get the loader memory for each machine ，Is there any good way?
275,"question for anyone who uses pyenv — should the `.python-version` file be commited to vcs, or is it considered good practise to ignore this file?"
275,"<@Carline> ignore, of course; That's an environmental detail"

276,I'm sure someone can help but you'll need to post more details :slightly_smiling_face:
276,I am using google cloud endpoints along with ndb datastore .; I am setting values in my request class parameters; can then I put these data in ndb; my api know the value of the variable; but right after I put; _post_put_hook function is called; but it does not know the value of that variable
276,Sorry I have never used google could endpoints so I can't really help you :confused:
276,<@Helene> can you post a snippet of your code ?
277,so i started using fantastical and i really like it but want to integrate other services. they didn’t make this very easy =(. to parse text outside of fantastical it says to type this: `<x-fantastical2://parse?s=Sentence> goes here` i tried this in a browser to no avail. does anyone know where i can type this sort of thing into osx?; i’ve tried spotlight but that didn’t work either.
277,Anyone have a simple to use GUI?
277,HTML?
277,"desktop?; tkinter, I'd say"
277,"Yeah desktop, and I saw tkinter, might have to go with that; has anyone worked with crucible/fish eye before?"
277,I've used crucible before; was ok; why?
277,"Basically grabbing analytics from it for peer reviews and then essentially updating a CSV with new data of progress of peer reviews; So I gotta use their API, hoping I can get the data I need"
277,not sure this will work but if you used a jupyter notebook they would have something essentially like a gui. they could run your code and get ouput and it be relatively easy.
277,"Uh oh, management wants insights... huh?"
277,"Haha, well they already get insights. It just gets tedious for the guys to hand type in all the updated info for each week for the last 12 weeks; and it has to be redone each time cause each week the analytics change of course for the weeks before also so they can spend an hour updating the thing; When python can do it in a few seconds :slightly_smiling_face:"
277,checkout a temp jupyter notebook here: <https://tmpnb.org/>
277,What is it exactly? <@Johana> temporary server for running python?
277,jupyter is cool
277,"&gt; The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more."
277,Hmmm okay that might be really convenient
277,plus it can be put on github and look cool
277,Sort of like a prelim thing I can show them when I'm done and they can decide if they want a GUI or not
277,you might have to setup your own jupyterhub server but it is relatively easy to do. the jupyterhub server can be setup to require username and password.; then no one needs to install anything.; they simply go to your page: <http://jupyter.kbman.com|jupyter.kbman.com> and login; i have an ansible playbook if needed :wink:; more info here: <https://jupyter.org/>
277,Once I get this setup I'll definitely get that setup
277,"if you are just looking to use basic jupyter, and you use pycharm you can start a new project, pip install jupyter then instead of making a .py file you can make a .ipynb file"
277,"since it is python the sky is the limit. if you want you can setup a way for the csv to be emailed to them or whatever.; the notebooks can also utilize `input` if you need the user to type in information.; so if you wanted to run a cli script inside the notebook and prompt them for their name, etc, you can do that."
277,That might actually be super convenient; Oh man this should be fun. The documentation for this API is leading me to 404 errors.
278,TIL ipython does input; <@Johana> can you show live terminal output in there?
278,what do you mean live?
278,Say I run a long-running subprocess
278,hmmm… idk. i would have to try it. you can run pip commands and they scroll out. that’s what is happening at the top.
278,"Or can you only spawn one and print the data; Oh, I guess I didn't think about how they have the syntax to run straight shell commands; <@Johana> :taco:; I totally spaced the `!shell command`"
278,yea it’s cool; i use jupyter notebook for one off things like this all the time.; very convenient
278,"Yeah, I was thinking about adding a subdomain to my site so I can just have one centralized"
278,i have an ansible playbook if you want to deploy jupyterhub.; you will have to pull all the the R things out of it.; one of my first projects where i work was setting up a jupyterhub with an R kernel and other packages.
278,"Oh yeah, I love references"
278,i’ll try to test it later on to make sure it works. haha
278,okie
278,i have a vm i can run the playbook.
278,Would love to have it too. <@Beula> one of pyslackers rôle? 
278,"We can do that for sure, make it a community effort; I'll start on breaking those up tonight if I have time"
278,:thumbsup: 
278,Do you still need help w/ this?
278,"<@Johana> another reason why rails is stupid:

* it's valid to do something like `<redis://localhost>`

278,"so i'm working on a small web app that will allow users to search instagram for two hashtags at the same time.  

the route of the app the user is given this form 

```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Enter two comma separated tags (no hashtag symbol!!!)&lt;/h1&gt;

my issue is that i'm trying to pass the next page token to the results page through the URL, so that when the user push the button for more results, ti gets sent back to the `/results` route.  right now when i load the ""more results"" i get a `500` error and it doesn't look like the token is being passed in the url properly because it is before the question mark

INFO:werkzeug:10.51.50.1 - - [18/Jul/2017 17:24:36] ""GET /results/J0HWW5ERQAAAF0HWW5CPQAAAFoAKAA%253D%253D? HTTP/1.1"" 500 -
```; this line in particular `<http://logging.info|logging.info>('REQUEST ARGS: {}'.format(request.args))` returns `INFO:root:REQUEST ARGS: ImmutableMultiDict([])`"
278,"What does the HTML of the page look like? That `{{ url_for('results', token=token) }}` bit should be expanded out, so you can verify what it's passing in; Oh, wait, the token does come through - I had to scroll down to see your Log line. But it's not in 'args', perhaps, and that's okay"
278,hm
280,You should try logging what `token` is equal to
278,kk
278,"Also, if you get a 500 error, normally that would give you a traceback, no? So you could see exactly where it breaks"
278,"ah, so it is coming though as the variable token, but it's not something i can parse from the url because it's not an actual arg; is there a better way to pass data from page to page? maybe with query params?"
278,"Maybe, but I don't see how that's relevant here - if you are getting 'token' correctly, it implies the problem is in your `fetch_data` call and how you pass token in is working"
278,Working with .csv/excel stuff should I be using just the `csv` module or `pandas/openpyxl`
278,"<@Liliana> I mean, the main problem with your code is that you don't do anything useful with a GET request"
278,yea im changing that now; think i got it from here (for now :simple_smile: ); thanks for the help

282,"Hello, I been looking for a way to create script that gathers info from yahoo finance or morning star, financial numbers I can calculate later on with python. I have found an interesting youtube tutorial which goes trough the same topic <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2zyPby4034&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDejNczz7dbpyu3JnwUBvNch> but the problem is that its in python 2 and some of the steps does not work anymore. I know thought that I can convert the python 2 to 3 and find some hacky ways how to do it still but I wonder if it's worth the effort. Maybe there are some better ways I can do with python 3. I readed a bit about modules like pandas and beautiful soup but not sure if they are fit for this purpose. Anyone could point me to a direction what would be the best method for gathering financial fundamental data? I am quite new to python"
278,"if the course is really good and the downside is the fact that it uses python 2 then i would just convert as i go. everything i’ve done so far with scipy, numpy, and pandas has worked in python 3.6. google the errors and tracebacks you get and i bet there are a lot of solutions.; the other option is using penv.; pyenv makes it pretty easy to run multiple python versions."
278,Someone on that youtube video also posted a package for it <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance/1.3.2>  - i havent tried it - just pointing it out
278,you could run the code in python 2 to just get it working and then conver to python 3

286,<@Sharlene> what are you trying to do? there are Python libs that do lots of financial stuff that you could just use. Unless you want to 'learn Python by doing' type of thing
285,"<@Thomasina> I see.  Do you have a py script anywhere where you imports ""backend"" first?; <@Thomasina> To asnwer your question: Yes.  It's hard to guess without the full code but pay close attention to __init__.py and your initial app import.  The folder structure needs to be what Flask expects or at least direct it to it if you're going the unconventional way.; <@Thomasina> Once you need to deploy this to a server, you ll need a wsgi script that would declare all the pathes as well. Otherwise you'll be banging your head trying to figure out why an ""moduleName importError"" is popping everywhere."
285,Only `__main__.py` is truncated there; Thanks for the heads up about WSGI! I hadn't gotten there yet but I hadn't made a WSGI script yet
285,<@Thomasina> where is your `app = Flask(__name__)`

288,What is the strategy to decide limit for number of processes when working with `multiprocessing`?
288,"I'd favor `concurrent.futures` (or the `futures` backport if you are on python2).; Basically you can define a pool with the max workers; ```
import concurrent.futures

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as pool:
    pool.submit(print, 'Hello World')
```; (untested and from memory <@Katheryn> :point_up::skin-tone-4:)"
288,"Sure, let me explore `futures`. So, I’ll be doing I/O with these forked processes. Reading from the web, suggestions are to keep workers equal to number of cores. Is that reasonable?"
288,"Yep, that's usually what I see/hear around. Note that if you are doing I/O - probably best to use `ThreadPoolExecutor` since your bottlekneck isn't CPU and processes in python are expensive; Especially resource sharing"

293,"I'm using Heroku and I want to add PostGIS to my Postgres database, however to do this I need to run in Windows command prompt:

293,"how are you working locally?; eg, dev/staging/prod with their own specific env configurations"
293,I just run my code locally...um...I guess that's it. I have the Heroku toolbelt. When I run the command with the toolbet I'm informed that psql.exe could not be found. After a quick search it seems it's because Postgres needs to be installed.; Sorry if I didn't understand your question correctly; I run my app in its development configuration when running it locally. Not that it's that much different from the other modes.
293,How can you be running locally if you use Postgres but don't have it installed? Are you accessing a Postgres instance remotely?; I didn't think Heroku had a local option
293,"it does, but you really should have everything replicated locally that's on heroky; as close to 1:1 as possible"
293,Aha. Still curious about how it handles the DB.
293,Ya I have no idea. I just want to get PostGIS running on Heroku. But I guess I'll need Postgres anyway if I intend to test my app locally. Currently I just plug it into an SQLite DB to test it.
293,"yup, switch that out for postgres."
293,"I must say that I did enjoy the simplicity though, and especially when we have new developers coming in. I wish Postgres could be self-contained somehow to avoid having to set anything up. Oh well."
293,That's the tradeoff though... SQLite basically has the whole database functionality built right into your application. That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.; If you're writing something for multiple developers to work on then everybody could share a Postgres installation on a central server
293,That's true. I suppose I could have everyone connect to the database on the Heroku staging Dyno for the project though...

294,try <#C0LMFRMB5|django>

301,"Hello, a design question for a slackbot. I’m using slack’s RTM APIs to establish a websocket connection with slack. Code is deployed on a single instance/machine and everything is working well. Now, I want one more production instance to ensure availability in case one is down. How can I replicate the deployment on two machines?"
301,You really can't with a slackbot <@Katheryn> - otherwise what would happen is you'd have two bots listening and responding to all events. You may need a fail-over instead where another machine starts up and starts the bot if the main machine fails (of course you would likely have a period of downtime during that failover)
301,"&gt; you’d have two bots listening and responding to all events.
Yeah, that was the problem even I had in mind. Should I explore on message queues?"
301,"I guess you could, I haven't checked for any that de-duplicate repeat messages though"
301,"I have never worked with message queues before. Can we have a configuration where event is consumed only by _one_ consumer at a time? Or, is it replicated to all of them?; But all this sounds too complicated, I think. We only have about 800 users using out bot"
301,"I am not aware of a way to only have one consumer listening at a time, but you could use a distributed lock for who is the ""active"" listener - but those are somewhat complicated.; consul has a mechanism to do this"
301,i'd just keep all the state in a database; messaging queues and consul in this would make things overly complicated in what's basically a feed consumption mechanism
301,"&gt; `i'd just keep all the state in a database`
Could you please elaborate more on this?"
301,"<@Katheryn> you have two services:
  service a: talks to Slack RTM, receives messages and puts them in incoming database, reads outgoing database, sends event to slack
  service b: consumes messages from incoming database, does logic to generate response, puts outgoing message onto database"
301,"That doesn't really solve the issue of service a going down though, which is the desire, from my understanding; e.g. HA consumer"
301,service b can run as many instances as you'd like; and you could run multiple service a as well if you wanted; you'd just have a constraint on message ID uniqueness in the DB
301,"so, basically, we are using database as an alternative to a message queue here?"
301,<@Katheryn> the difference with a DB is the unique constraint if you get message IDs; so you could have any number of consumers from the RTM api
301,alternative isn't quite the right phrase i think
301,I see
301,"But depending on your load, you may get some DB locking issues. With 800 users, you are probably OK; even our chat at its busiest wouldn't cause any trouble (that I can think of)"
301,message queues are really good for service discovery but not as good for reliable storage
301,"If you wanted the distributed systems approach for load:

1. N consumers -&gt; Rabbitmq Excahnge
2. RabbitMQ Exchange to any bound queues
  *  One queue subscribed for saving to a DB
  * Another for processing

You can do different routing mechanisms so the same work goes to the same worker, but instead just allow dupes and test for dupes on the consumer side; But that's way overly complicated for the current need, it sounds"
301,"Yes, I would agree. I am more inclined towards <@Marcie> suggestion.
One more question, I am using `crontab` as a kind of “automated restart” setup for my bot’s running service and other scheduled events. Few days ago, there was a problem with `crontab`. Not sure about the cause. Any suggestions on improving this setup? Alternatives to `crontab`?; Can we have notifications setup to know if `cron` didn’t run?"
301,"Are you polling for it to be up or something?; A `systemd` service would be better, IMO"
301,"Well, I’m using `cron` to poll and monitor for my bot’s running process. So, to poll cron, we need another monitor?"
301,"No, systemd would replace that need"
301,RabbitMQ with HA queues and publisher confirms is a pretty good reliable storage for temporary data
301,"basically the OS has a construct to ensure a process is always running at a certain ""runlevel""; Look into `systemctl` or `systemd` <@Katheryn>; they should be synonymous"
301,"Thank you <@Beula> , you are a great help. Will read on those
<@Beula> :taco:
<@Marcie> :taco:"

301,"<@Katheryn> :thumbsup::skin-tone-4: here is an example from the <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> bot (<@Alesia> ) <https://github.com/pyslackers/ansible/blob/master/roles/system_service/templates/etc/systemd/system/service.j2>; It's using ansible, so slightly obfuscated, but should give a good example if you can read through that"
302,"<@Alvin> Unfortunately after changing `from . import config` in `__init__.py` to `from broadway import config` I still receive the error:
```from broadway import create_app, models, util
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'broadway'```
Thanks anyway though. It was worth a shot. :slightly_smiling_face:; `latitude = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False, asdecimal=True)` gives me `Unknown arguements passed to Clumn: ['asdecimal']`...am I doing something wrong here?"
302,"not sure how to pass an argument to `db.Float` when constructing a Column with ORM; but you can achieve the same with:; `latitute = db.Column(db.Decimal, nullable=False)`; `db.Decimal` (or `db.Numeric`, which is the same) is basically `db.Float` with `asdecimal=True`"
302,<@Suellen> `db.Decimal` didn't work but `db.Numeric` did. Thanks! :smile:
302,:slightly_smiling_face:
303,"Is it better to have a local Postgres database for local testing of my app, or just have Postgres connect to the remote database on the staging server? :thinking_face:; I can think of pros and cons to both, but I think that it's likely one of them is considered best practice..."
303,"It doesn't matter, although you want to be accessing a separate _database_ on it (i.e. `CREATE DATABASE testing`)"
303,<@Gabriele> A different database on the staging server though? Wouldn't that be redundant or am I missing something?
303,"I would say that it is good practice to have local, staging and production environments; with everything as close to 1:1 as possible; and not doing so is a major red flag"
303,You don't want your testing environment accidentally trashing your live or staging environment.
303,seen that happen :slightly_smiling_face:
303,"<@Meg> So, as in having a separate database locally, on the staging dyno, and on the production dyno? (Already have the latter two)"
303,"correct; so, you work on a laptop, right?"
303,"I work on my desktop at home, but switch to a laptop when I work remotely sometimes."
303,"what happens if you want to do a little bit of testing in an area with spotty wifi, eg a coffee shop with a saturated network; if you have a local db, that's one less network resource you need to worry about"
303,That's a good point. Actually I sometimes work places without any internet.; Guess that's been decided then. Thanks :smile:
303,"so you can keep a small portion of the prod db on your local machine; don't need to replicate the entire thing fully, especially if you have multi-gigs of records; just enough to have testing and data integrity :slightly_smiling_face:; furthermore, if you use vagrant or docker, you can make onboarding and environment issues between developers much smoother; because _everyone_ is working from the same environment; no worries about Windows issues when 3/4s of your team are on Linux"
303,<@Meg> Docker isn't for Windows?
303,"you misunderstand me; docker is cross platform, and isolates your codebase from the environment; <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/>"
303,"<@Meg> Oh, yes, I just didn't understand your last sentence I guess. Thanks for telling me about Docker. For some reason I thought Docker was another PaaS or something. Is it actually meant to compliment other PaaS?"
304,Anyone here familiar with PostGIS?
304,I've done a bit with it.
304,<@Gabriele> Cool! Do you know where I might be able to get my hands on some sample geography data to experiment with? I have a database but it's full of shape and geometry data and I want to try querying for all objects within a certain radius of a point which I can't do without geography data.
304,you should be able to convert from geometry to geography; <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/18011/is-it-possible-to-convert-from-geography-to-geometry-in-postgis>
305,"and furthermore, regarding docker

so, docker basically puts a bare bones VM in which you specify containers for parts of your application stack.; so, if you're on windows and another dev is on mac"
304,"<@Thomasina>  I personally just used data from sources like Google Maps, querying for places and their long/lat, and adding to my DB"
305,"you can ensure that whatever issues you have are code related and not OS related; furthermore, bringing in a new dev and getting them integrated with the projects is much simpler, because you already hhave the environment and code _right there_"
304,"<@Gabriele> Through the Google Maps API? Or do they have downloadable datasets?
<@Meg> Thanks! I'll look into that. Also, Docker does sound really useful. I'm going to check them out! Thanks! :smile:"
304,through the API
304,"<@Thomasina> <@Gabriele> <http://workshops.boundlessgeo.com/postgis-intro/geography.html#casting-to-geometry>; if you already have the data, no need to use google maps; and the US Census bureau already has plenty of data for download; <https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html>"
304,"Yeah, I wasn't suggesting he use Google Maps, just saying that my application did"
304,ah ok
304,"<@Gabriele> Oh, sorry I suppose I actually misunderstood my problem. I'm running this query:
`SELECT * FROM towns WHERE ST_Distance_Sphere(geom, ST_MakePoint(71.3033,44.2706)) &lt;= 150 * 1609.34`
and the error is:
```ERROR:  BOOM! Could not generate outside point!
CONTEXT:  SQL function ""st_distance_sphere"" statement 2```
By `statement 2` I think it's actually referring to `ST_MakePoint(71.3033,44.2706)`. This is a valid lat/long though and looking at the documentation it appears `ST_MakePoint` does in fact accept a lat/long. :thinking_face:; <@Meg> Oh, not sure why census data never occurred to me. Nice!"
304,"you're in canada, right?  there should be something similar for you there; <http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2016-eng.cfm>"
304,"Yep. Although any dataset with a lot of records is good. I think I used the US census site awhile ago when doing machine learning so I'm a bit familiar with it, so I'd probably just use that again.; Oh, well since I don't have to look for it I might use the Canadian information then. :joy: Thanks; What I'm trying to do is get all recorded locations within a radius of a specific lat/long. I'm using PostGIS now which has been nice so far, but I'm wondering if there might be an even simpler solution..."
304,and regarding your query; what is `geom`
304,To get all locations within a radius of somewhere is exactly the right sort of problem for PostGIS
304,yeah; because you're working with spatial data
304,The only simpler solution is to call someone else's API to perform the same operation on their database
304,and postgis is highly optimized; you could do a naive solution; but it would be significantly less performant
304,`geom` is a column containing geometry data (in this case it's the boundaries of towns in a small section of the US).
304,<https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DistanceSphere.html>
304,"It needs points, not just any arbitrary geometry"
304,Well I better stick with PostGIS then. While load will be very light at first it could become quite heavy later on.
304,"for example, make a multilinestring"
304,<@Gabriele> I assumed the geometry was in projectable coordinates...?
304,<@Thomasina> if you want more help about gis stuff; <http://thespatialcommunity.org/>
304,It needs one single point
304,<@Meg> Oh nice! Didn't think there'd be a Slack for this. I requested an invite now.
304,are you using flask or django for this
304,"<@Gabriele> Oh yeah, my bad. I guess what I want to do then (to keep things simple) is to work out the center-point of each shape first."
304,"I think there are other functions that are more lenient on which types they accept for distance calculations, but the docs for that one suggest that it doesn't"
304,<@Meg> Flask
304,"<https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>; might want to use that instead of raw queries, especially now"
304,"<@Meg> Oh, yep, you or <@Gabriele> (or somebody at least) posted that here the other day so I have it. I'm running these queries raw in pgAdmin against the database though just to familiarize myself without having to run a .py script each time. :slightly_smiling_face:"
304,"there isn't a shell for flask, like there is for django?"
304,There is
304,so why not use that ORM instead?
304,but my database in my Flask app isn't set up with the proper data
304,gotcha
304,"I just loaded a sample dataset into a database in my local postgres install to play with it, for now; Once I feel comfortable with how it works and the data I need and how to structure the tables for my data I'll do that part (hopefully soon!)"
304,alright
306,"So I've loaded a table with a list of world cities but I'm not getting the expected results. For example I can run `SELECT * FROM cities WHERE ST_DWithin(geog, ST_MakePoint(45.4215,75.6972)::geography, 470000)` which _should_ return Toronto and a number of other surrounding cities. I've confirmed that Toronto exists in the database with the expected lat/long. However 0 rows are returned. :disappointed:"
304,I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've been following examples from articles and there are no errors returned...tried a few variations too.
304,dear friendssss; why does python tell me:
306,<@Thomasina> Do you ever get any results? e.g. if you increase the distance to a very large number?
304,FileNotFoundError: File b’Macintosh HD/Users/Desktop/Programming/AAPL.csv’ does not exist; <@Shelly>; i copied and pasted the path tho
304,"<@Gabriele> Yes, I increased the number to something huge like 57000000 and had some results - from somewhere very far away from Toronto, or North America for that matter."
304,"<@Kandis>, try adding a forward slash before ""Macintosh"""
304,<@Winnifred>  it shows me the same thing
306,"<@Thomasina> _""the source geometries must both be of the same coordinate projection""_... are you sure the data is all correct?"
304,<@Kandis> I'm not a Mac user but where are you running your script from? Is that path relative to the location of your script?
304,I don't think you need to include the MAC HD bit in your path
304,<@Thomasina> yes its exactly the location
304,The path looks to be attempting to be absolute but is missing the initial slash
304,HAHA! i got it; <@Winnifred> you are right
304,The if/main thing simply means: if executing this script directly run this code. It allows you to have a module that is runnable or importable (that code won't run on import)
304,"<@Gabriele> So I took a very large dataset of world cities in .csv and imported them into my database, then I added a `geog` column and used `UPDATE cities SET geog = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326);` which ran without errors. Did I perhaps miss something in that command?"
304,how does one “executes this code”
304,"Probably not, but that's beyond my knowledge"
304,`python myscript.py`
304,how does one “executes this script”***; oh!
304,<@Thomasina> :taco: 
304,vs. running `python myotherscript.py` - on a script containing `import myscript`; <@Beula> :fork_and_knife:
304,Although it looks like you're assigning geometry to a geography column... not sure if that's okay or not
304,"There aren't all that many times when I have enough knowledge to help around here, so I try to do it when I can.; Maybe I should have ran `ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)::geography`?"
304,Nice!
304,ST_SetSRID returns geometry
304,Oh does it? I used the command because I think it was in a solution on StackOverflow...now I can't seem to find the page so maybe I just got mixed up. :joy:
304,Those commands look fine - but if you try to assign a geometry to a geography column I don't know what will happen
304,"I see... Well, I'm having a lot of difficulty finding a way of populating a geography column from lat/long coordinates :confused:"
304,you probably just want a geometry column
304,"Ok so I found the StackOverflow post. I see that it was recommended to run `ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(long, lat), 4326)::geography`. I omitted casting completely.; After reading it doesn't sound like geometry would be a good fit as my use case involves locations on a global scale; Unless I misunderstand the pros/cons which is certainly possible"
304,Usually it'll depend on what sort of distances are involved
304,"i am still trying to figure it out lol; The if/main thing simply means: if executing this script directly run this code. It allows you to have a module that is runnable or importable (that code won’t run on import); this script here means this chuck of code?; chunk*; this code means:
import pandas as pd
def test_run():
    df=pd.read_csv(‘/Users/elaineyang/Desktop/Programming/AAPL.csv’)
    print(df); ?; and can i say, whenever i import something i have to have “if __name__==‘__main__‘:”; or else the imported code cant be run?; <@Thomasina>"
304,"So for example, I have this script:

```
# cat.py
class Cat:
    def say(self):
        print(""meow"")


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    Cat().say()
```

I can either call it directly: `python cat.py` and it will meow.

But say I have another module that wants to use this class:

```
from cat import Cat

class ChesireCat(Cat):
    def dress_up(self):
        pass
```

I wouldn't want it to meow until I tell it to
"
304,"<@Kandis>
So everything...oh wait he beat me to it :joy:; <@Beula> :lightning: :runner:"
304,lol
304,"The background on this is that `__name__` is a build in dunder (double underscore). It is set to the name of the module running - if the module is executed directly it's ""__main__"", otherwise I think it defaults to the file name (I don't recall ATM); Tldr you only need the if name/main if you want to be able to execute some code when the script is directly invoked"
304,"so accordin to what you said, how do you let it say meow on the second code; from cat import Cat

class ChesireCat(Cat):
    def dress_up(self):
        pass"
304,"That class inherited the meow method, so make an instance and call say on it!

Sorry, a class may have been a bad example"
304,<@Beula> <@Thomasina> <@Winnifred> :taco: thanks so much!
304,<@Kandis> :knife_fork_plate: Thanks! I was actually pretty hungry.
304,haha you havent had breakfast; we share the same time zone!; oh you meant my taco; lmfao
304,"Oh, cool! Didn't notice the time zone. Actually I had a small breakfast but I woke up at 1AM, so I haven't eaten in 8 or 9 hours. :dizzy_face:"
304,:fearful: hope your bed time is not usually like this lol it doesnt sound good
304,"Haha, I don't really have a bedtime. Sometimes I'm going to sleep at 10PM, other times 6AM, other times 2PM. It seems to change every day too. I can't hold a schedule. Today maybe I'll sleep around...I'm not even sure...8PM? I was a night owl but now I'm a cuckoo bird it seems. :joy:; <@Kandis> By the way, if you don't mind me asking, I'm just really curious; are you learning Python for school?"
304,"haha! i learn it for my career :joy: i wanna be able to build a trading program and things like that; i am studying finance at school; python is kinda cool. i was thinking of learning SQL or R after it, but woah, python seems deep enough for me to learn quite a while <@Thomasina>"
304,"<@Kandis> Oh, niiiice! That's really cool. Yes, I'm not sure whether R would be all that helpful if you learn Python, although learning at least basic SQL could come in handy sometimes. I suppose you'll be doing a lot of data science in your field? Perhaps machine learning?; I've been doing web and software dev for a long time but started learning Python more recently as it was required for a project involving machine learning."
304,"see. i found something online, here:; Banks use Python for pricing, risk management and trade management platforms. More recently, they’ve been reprogramming their trading systems to run off Python rather than other, clunkier languages."
304,I was a finance person <@Kandis> - started with python too :smile:
304,"<@Beula> Oh that's right! Then did you work with pandas, numpy, scikit or similar tech?; I'm not sure how long ML has played a big role in finances but would be interested in knowing."
304,<@Beula> so cool. was python helpful to you during work?
304,"No, I was more in the retail side (to clients directly, vs in a bank) and at the time I didn't know how much was out there!; Yeah <@Kandis> , I wasn't doing a ton of high intensity stuff with it - but I was able to remove about 10-12hours of work/week by automating silly tasks"
304,so cooooooool; were you in a retail bank you said?; what kind of bank; <@Beula>
304,"No, the retail side (not a bank). I was a financial advisor; and stock trader for clients"
304,"<@Kandis> I believe there's a ton of opportunity in this space, and it also allows you to branch in different directions should the economy change. Not only a lot of jobs but a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities as well. It's a smart choice."
304,<@Beula> SO COOL what do you do now then; <@Thomasina> :+1::skin-tone-3:
307,"I sometimes use this for simple unittests. The module is meant to be imported, but I have a few things I want to test that can be tested individually, so throw it under an if name main at the bottom and test away.

I wouldn't suggest this for a larger project though, but for something simple or just to test in development it works."
304,That's a good idea! Do you ever use doctest too? It's excellent for simple functions <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>
304,plt.grid(True); what does this mean
304,I want to learn python . What is the best resource to refer for object oriented python ?
304,"<@Kandis> I'm not entirely sure what library `plt` is referring to but if I'm correct I think it simply enables the display on a grid in any charts you generate.; Oh ya, probably pltlib"
304,"<@Helene> Do you know any other programming languages, or are you just starting out?"
304,"<@Kandis> might mean the matplotlib library, since `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` is common convention; and for future reference, when you ask these kind of questions (what does this variable do, etc), its best to add some more information; and in this case, if you had the code in front of you, you could search for instances of `plt` in the code; which would have brought you to the import statement, among others"
304,yea i just didnt know the grid(True) part and kai_m answered me ;D
304,yup . I know basic programming .
304,understood
304,but my concepts of object oriented programming are not so cool .
308,can you suggest some good resources ?
308,Hoping others come along that are newer than I am with their resources they used :smile:
308,and can you share some advanced resources you use ?; May be something may help
308,"You can go through the python tutorial, otherwise I just look at stuff as they come up. <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>

314,"I know you can use a `with` block in some other test packages, but to be honest this seems like a weird thing to be testing for"
315,"You could probably use `self.assertIn(""donation"", item.__dict__)` or some similar abomination if you really want a one-liner"
315,"<@Gabriele> Yeah it sounds weird, but actually the object under test is some kind of container giving both attribute and keyed lookup access to a set of properties, and I need to test whether the right exceptions are thrown during lookup of a nonexistent property."
315,"Sounds like a bad idea to me. But if I had to write tests for it, I'd just use the __dict__ check directly. Or `hasattr`."
315,"<@Gabriele> Bad idea? You have a better idea? Thanks for the `hasattr` tip! This is what it's all about, the `Bunch` object: <https://github.com/motoom/bunch>"
315,"I think that is unnecessarily blurring the lines between a container and a type. If you don't know what attributes a type has, then you don't really know what interface it provides, which makes it a very awkward object to work with"
315,"<@Gabriele> I use it declutter my source code. Basically it is a `dict` like object where you don't have to type `[""` and `""]` all the time. So I can write:```; ```for r in bunched(recordset): # Where recordset is fetch_all() of DictCursor
   if r.salary &lt; 3000:
      print r.name, ""could use a raise""
```; Psycopg2 has a `NamedTupleCursor`, which provides the same syntax."
315,"In that case, at least the schema is documented elsewhere. But I don't like it."
315,"The alternative would be:
```
for r in recordset:
   if r[""salary""] &lt; 3000:
        print r[""name""], ""could use a raise""
```
You prefer that?"
315,Maybe
315,I can work like that. You have a job for me? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
315,"In the general case, yes. It's not exactly a great hardship. In a database context, it might be nice to have a type that directly reflects the DB schema - which is what we have ORM for"
315,"btw, the `NamedTupleCursor` gets its attribute names from the fields behind the *SELECT*. I.e. `select name, salary from Employees` would result in *.name* and *.salary* attributes on the tuples in the resultset."
315,"I just really dislike things that attempt to cut down on a bit of typing by ruining the interface. Several parsers do it, like BeautifulSoup. lxml.objectify is even worse"
315,I wouldn't call it ruining. It makes the code more readable to me. I prefer dot notation over index lookup with a string.
315,"The dot notation and the index lookup carry different information. `x.y` implies that `y` _must_ exist. `x[""y""]` implies that a value for ""y"" might exist, if someone added it earlier."
315,"Except xml node is not a container, but an object :confused:"
315,"Ah, we have a different view on that too. When I see `x[""y""]` in code, I assume the programmer knows that an *y* value is present, or should be present (punishable by KeyError). When I see `x.get(y)`, then I know the programmer is trying to communicate to me that *y* perhaps does not exist in *x*."
315,"it's an object that contains an arbitrary number of other objects; <@Ruben>  But the point is that you see it's a dict, and that the contents vary; Obviously you can make assumptions if you know what's been added, but the syntax tells you the nature of the structure you're working with"
315,"<@Gabriele> Yeah there you have a point, `x[""y""]` certainly conveys that *x* is a dict.; ...or at least a mapping type on which you can do indexed lookups.; Now wouldn't it be fun to override `__getitem__()` to call a memberfunction instead of looking up a value, and have `__call__()` lookup an indexed item?; You could write `a[""save""]` to call functions and `a(""age"")` to lookup values.; :joy:"
316,I'm trying to use Pycharm CE with Flask but I can't seem to configure a interpreter to run `virtualenv/Scripts/flask` or `python -m flask run`. Is there anyway to run Flask applications inside Pycharm without having to buy the pro version?
316,"<@Fern> I believe you just need to set the interpreter to the virtualenv Python, then in the run panel you use flask as the script; That's not an exclusive pro feature as far as i know"
316,How would I reference flask as the script?; <@Beula>; <@Patty> not possible
316,Send a pic of what you see
316,I'm also stuck on Windows...
316,What does that have to do with the pycharm config?; Send a pic of your pycharm window; The config
316,"Default, which points to my main.py; Ignore the script parameters, it was just me playing around"
316,"Script should point to flask from the virtualenv, if you're in one; Flask is the script/executable"
316,in `env\Scripts`?
316,`which flask` would show the path on posix
316,yes that's right; but I can't use that in Pycharm since it is an EXE file
316,"Then be sure to set the working directory in that same window to the project root (where main is); On mobile, I'll check back when I get to my office"
316,Windows BS
316,"one reason I suggest using a virtual machine; eg, docker or vagrant; anything other than java or C# on windows is more trouble than its worth, in my experience"
316,agree <@Meg>
316,"I have Flask running just fine in PyCharm on Windows. Not at the machine now, though."
316,Community Edition <@Gabriele> ?
316,"No, but I don't expect it matters"
316,"Pro set's everything up automatically, used it at my last job"
316,I never use automatic setup. I would have done it manually; I just filled in the fields as in Joe's screenshot
316,do you remember what use set the Script file to?
316,"No. I might just have a file which contains `app.run()`.; Apparently that's not recommended any more, probably because it doesn't play nicely with other aspects of Flask that I'm not a fan of"
317,kylotan: not a fan of many things; :slightly_smiling_face:
317,Only with flask
316,"it is true, I'm pretty unhappy with most software I work with"
317,haha; i'm sticking with `app.run()`` for now
318,"plt.plot(t, t, 'r--', t, t**2, 'bs', t, t**3, 'g^')
Takes arguments in sets of 3:
&gt; (x-val, y-val, 'color/shape')
Each plots a function.

So `t, t, 'r--'`  corresponds to one line, `t, t**2`, 'bs'` to another, and `t, t**3, 'g^'` to another.

'r--', 'bs' and 'g^' indicate color and shape. example: 'g^' stands for green triangles."
318,Best way to approach calling function using a dictionary to store the func object as a value. I'm doing this in a class so it doesn't quite work properly the traditional way of literally just using the function object name as the value.

322,ok got it
322,I'm trying to wrap my head around GeoAlchemy but I'm having a really hard time. I have a lat and lon column in my table...should I be using a geometry column instead?
322,yes
322,"Ok...but I'm not sure if I should be using geography or geometry...If I wanted to show points over the size of, say, the continental US, would that be a problem with geometry?"
322,"Are you showing points over that sort of area within a single query? And what are your accuracy requirements?; PostGIS is definitely awkward to work with, I'll give you that. And understanding the geom/geog stuff, and converting between them, is fiddly. But stick at it.; I have a geography column in my DB (specifically, `geography(Point,4326) NOT NULL`), and it works for me. I only need to find places near other places, and each place is represented with a point, so I don't have rigorous requirements on accuracy, or the need for it to be correct over long distances; So I could probably have been okay with a geometry object"
322,"The accuracy doesn't have to be particularly high at that distance, just good enough that if the user zooms in on that point on the map it doesn't drift so much that it appears to be flying across the map. Haha
Thank you for your encouragement! I am determined to figure it out. :slightly_smiling_face:
I suppose that the important part is showing points within a much smaller scale (say a few city blocks in each direction) within about 5 meters of accuracy. I'm just thinking though that even if the large scale stuff isn't important, why not use geography anyway?"
322,"Geography has fewer functions available on it, so you need to convert to geometry to perform various tasks; I mostly just compare distances, so geography is fine. The geography type basically exists to allow for accurate distance comparisons; But trying to perform complex perimeter or area calculations on the surface of a not-quite-sphere is complex, so for that sort of thing, I think that is where they require you to project to geometry and suck up some error"
322,"Ah I see. Makes sense. The only thing that's important is that I'm able to get everything within a box (which will be the area the user is viewing in the app). Distance between points, perimeters, and areas, aren't important"
322,"Sounds like you want the ST_Contains test. It operates on geometry. Make a polygon of your box, test it against the points.; There's also ST_Covers for geography, but it appears less used."
324,"<https://www.amazon.com/PostGIS-Action-2nd-Regina-Obe/dp/1617291390/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500718692&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=postgis+in+action>; <@Thomasina> if you're going to do more work in this regard, I would suggest you buy that book and review it carefully."
324,"<@Meg> Thanks! This looks like it would be very helpful for me. If I need to do much more PostGIS stuff after this I think I should strongly consider buying it; <@Gabriele> Oh ok, I'll take a look at ST_Contains"
324,"well, considering your project is very reliant on GIS, I would get it regardless"
324,"Well, I would but I'm super duper tight on money at the moment so unfortunately I need to try to hold off for the time being. I'll definitely take a look when I have a bit more money to spend though :slightly_smiling_face:"
324,:thumbsup:
324,My Alembic or more specifically SqlAlchemy-Migrate keeps trying to drop the spatial_ref_sys table required by PostGIS. Is there a way to make it ignore it?
324,<@Thomasina> <http://dev.utek.pl/2013/ignoring-tables-in-alembic/>; &gt; While working on spatial enabled application I came up to a problem with spatial table in my postgres database (spatial_ref_sys). Alembic insisted on deleting this table as it wasn't declared in my models.py.; I think it's your situation described
324,"<@Suellen> Yep, exactly. :smile: Thanks!"
324,:slightly_smiling_face:
324,One thing that confuses me a bit is that his `run_migrations_online` function is _completely_ different from mine. :thinking_face:; It makes me wonder if this is built on an older version of the function and if replacing mine with this could lead to problems
324,"You can probably adapt it somehow; BTW, Alemic docs states that migrations should not be committed without human inspection first, so a really simple solution is to manually remove the ""drop table"" bits; Not really a beautiful solution, but still"
324,<@Suellen> Oddly removing the `drop`s manually fixes the error _but_ none of the model tables were created in the database... :facepalm:
324,:open_mouth:
324,"So just dropped the alembic table, deleted the migrations folder and did the whole process over but still no tables? Not sure what I'm doing wrong.; Then again the migration script has nothing in it for creating the relevant tables. :thinking_face:; Only code for dropping the PostGIS table which I removed"
324,it means that it can't detect your models for whatever reason :confused:
324,"Oh! Yes, I just changed my models from subclassing `Model` to subclassing `Base` from `declarative_base`. Guess that's why.; I'm not sure if that was a good idea but I couldn't help but notice that subclassing `Model` wasn't something done much outside of tutorials."
324,:cry:
324,:upside_down_face: :question:
324,This is from a real-life product
324,"Isn't it necessary to derive from Model if you use flask-sqlalchemy, and Base if you just use bare sqlalchemy? There is a difference, as I found out"
324,"Why with most SQLAlchemy extensions do they show a couple examples - usually ORM and core - and neither one of them look like this?; <@Gabriele> Good to know. :sweat_smile:; I may be but a novice Python dev, but someday I aspire to be a mediocre intermediate dev!"
324,"You most definitely will be; &gt; and neither one of them look like this?
Eh, I asked myself the same question. Turns out, writing a tutorial based on real-world applications isn't fun for anyone; Novices will 100% be confused; it's way easier to show the first 2-3 steps with Core or ORM, and move on to the first steps in anything else :slightly_smiling_face:"
324,To be completely honest I found machine-learning less confusing :smile:; I have a sort of love-hate relationship with it
324,you must be good with maths
324,"Not that great, but I do enjoy learning math. Honestly read about calculus and all sorts of things for fun. I wasn't really crazy about math as a kid so I'm not sure why that changed.; I was doing the Stanford ML course from Coursera but had to stop at one point once things became a bit too complex. I still intend to go back to it after studying more though."
325,What is an pythonic way to specify class dependencies?
325,"```

325,"<@Fern> `foo = Foo(dependency_a, dependency_b)`; You don't need DI framework in python, really"

Can I implement a special attribute like `__json__`?
325,marshmallow is the tool to go

But Flask can play nicely with WebSockets for example"
325,"Hmm; ""However Flask is just not designed for large applications or asynchronous servers. Flask wants to make it quick and easy to write a traditional web application."""
325,No you can't really do asyncio with flask. 
325,What happens if I try? :grin:
325,"There's some gevent based options for flask that makes it ""async"", but generally it's considered best to have a background worker do asnyc things (celery or rq)"
325,so I would be better of to use aiohttp?
325,"You can combine sync with async by using `loop.run_until_complete`. it will work locally, but once you run in thread mode (prod) you wont have an event loop."
325,don't want to use any queuing
325,"<@Fern> if making lots of remote calls in parallel is required for returning the response, i would use an asyncio framework. Sanic is flasklike; Aiohttp is also a good option. "
325,Seems nice; Then I just need to figure out how to get JWT auth working :smile:
326,jwt-extended!
325,that may work with the Sanic API
325,"<@Fern> better have `to_dict` method, so you can serialize it into more than just json"
326,"Say, yaml"
325,I'm considering how to make this part python 2 friendly
326,"it works, but I have to do it in a couple of places in my script"
325,what is the proper way to make this code work in both python 2 and python 3?
325,The quick and easy way is to just make a function that gets the basename from your string.

328,"`sed -r` is an extended mode, so that `+` is enabled (matches one or more characters, unlike `*` that matches zero or more); `s///g` or `s|||g` or any symbol instead of `|` is how a basic replacing expression is constructed.
The first field is what to match, the second is what to replace it with.; `(.+)/[^/]+/([^/]+)/.+`
`(.+)/` matches anything from the start until the first `/` and puts found characters in the first group (`\1`); `[^/]+/` matches anything that is not a slash, and then a slash (`vag/` or `home/`); `([^/]+)/` matches the same thing, but puts the stuff found in-between slashes in the second group `\2`; and then `.+` matches whatever comes next to the end of line; and the second field tells sed to replace the line with `\1\2`, so our saved groups side-by-side: the first group was everything before the first slash, and the second group was the stuff between 2nd and 3rd slashes"

335,Good morning.  I am working with Socket for the first time. I have hit on an error and it is so generic google is not very useful this morning.  I was hoping to get some direction I get error 54 connection reset.   I am going to supply the full script as a snip right after this message.  This is a super basic thing to download some RFC as a test of learning Sockets a bit.
335,"""socket"" is lower-case, by the way... it's not a package, it's just a low-level networking concept. Error 54 / ""connection reset"" is just an obscure way of the operating system telling you that the connection was closed.; It is usually helpful to know which line the error came from (it'll be in the traceback). It also looks like your HTTP request is missing a blank line after the header, but maybe I've misremembered that part"
335,TRUE
335,"<@Ressie> any reason for sockets over just making HTTP requests?; Additionally, that site is served over HTTPS. so you’ll need to use SSL to make the requests then via sockets"
335,<@Patty> simple exercise. I would normaly work up the stack.  I am just trying to get a deep understanding of said lower stacks.
335,"okay, well you’ll have to use SSL since <http://ietf.org|ietf.org> forces https. there may be some better exercises for playing with sockets, like some real-time communication for instance"
335,if you have a good excersie shoot it my way
335,maybe if you can run an echo server locally then you can test connecting to that; (e.g. <https://gist.github.com/solusipse/6419144> looks okay - and you can modify that code too)

343,"Hi, does anyone have time to help me with a simple regex string?"
343,"<@Christa> You usually have the best luck just posting the question, someone will usually be along to help out"
343,"Ok. So my question is: 

I have the following folder structure: 

C:\ 
    -0.82\

I have this line of code: 

`app.connect(path=r""C:\0.82\file.exe"")`

Then, the C:\ folder gets updated and I have this: 


C:\ 
    -0.82\
    -0.86\

Now I want to use regex to connect to the folder 0.86\

`app.connect(path=r""C:\0.\d\d\file.exe"")`

But that wasn't right and I don't understand regex.  Can someone please describe how to use regex correctly in this scenario?"
343,"Is the file update deterministic? If so - you may not want regex; My guess is one of your issues will be the backslashes from the windows path, which are ""escape sequences"" in regex, so `C:\0.\d`, `\0.` probably isn't what you want, `\0` is escaping ""0"" and then `.` is any char, I think a starting point may be: `C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`"
343,@hi; Can any one suggest the document for managing pcap files for replaying SNMP traps?
343,The file update is somewhat incremental; I'm not sure what's going on. There is an 'r' prefixed in the string so its a raw string and \\ is not needed to escape the file path \ in this case. Can you update your answer with this in mind?
343,"It actually does need the escapes in the regex string, it gets compiled and `\d` is a ""digit"", and `\0` isn't anything, so your regex needs to escape; If you read the docs for the `re` package - you'll see the same behavior I describe, all the raw strings still escape the special chars"
343,<@Jame> what google says: <http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/>
343,"<@Christa> Here is a snippet from the official docs:

&gt; Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string literal.
&gt; 
&gt; *The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r""\n"" is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while ""\n"" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation."
343,"I'm sort of confused.  Do I have to prefix the string with a function 

 re(`C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`); re(`""C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe""`); or re(r`C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`)"
343,"If you are searching for something: `re.search(r'&lt;regex_string&gt;', source_string)`"
343,"in this case, its just file directories.. How do I got about choosing?"
343,Choosing between what?
343,Folder names
343,"As I said before, I believe regex is the wrong approach"
343,Any suggestions to the correct approach?; Or at least a working one
343,"If it's always an incrementing number, the easy solution is list the directory (`os.listdir`), convert them into floats, and take the highest"
343,OMG You're awesome!; :slightly_smiling_face:
343,"I like the old acronym, KISS -&gt; Keep it simple stupid. (not calling you stupid, so please don't misread that!); <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>"
343,"Heard of that! I am not familiar with the os library and I was familiar with regex so I wouldnt have thought of that solution without you!; As a follow up, as a beginner python programmer, how was I supposed to know that os.listdir was a valid path to take without asking someone else for their sage advice"
343,"You did the right thing, you asked for help! That's a good way to find other solutions.; What you had is called an X-Y problem, you wanted to get the next file - and thought regex was the answer so you asked how to do the regex; Those of us that have been around the block once or twice try to understand the actual problem, to make sure we answer the right question"
343,"You're right.  I shouldve just asked how to do it, at first. I still want to learn how to use regex tho :stuck_out_tongue:; Oh well, hopefully another time. Thanks, again!"
343,"If you want to do the regex way you'd do something similar, you'd use a ""capture group"", convert them to floats, then compare. Much more involved and harder to maintain :smile:; it probably still requires listing the dir too"
344,"Hi All, I am trying to get apache running on webserver for django application. When trying to query it i am getting 301 and 405 response; anything that i am missing?"
344,What's the location header of the `301`?; You can check with `curl -i &lt;path&gt;` if you are unfamiliar
344,<@Beula> i am very new to this. what is value to use in &lt;path&gt;
344,"The path is the url:  `curl -i localhost:8000/admin`, for example; As an example, see this request:

344,It worked fine. I ran into some permission issue but it is now resolved. Thank you for all the nelp
345,<@Thomasina> the first example sets an SRID of 4386 (WGS84).  the second example doesn't set an SRID and should get the default for geometry which is 0
345,<@Willena> Will that cause a big difference in the resulting values?
345,"Depends what your doing.  When SRID is 0, the data gets treated like it's on a Cartesian plane (flat).  Using 4326 allows for a round earth.  If you're trying to do things like get the distance between two points, it can make a difference."
345,<@Willena> That was the best explanation I could have hoped for. I'd looked it up before but none of the explanations made as much sense as what you said right now. Haha; I'm trying to find all points inside a square; I also see that PostGIS says on the site `DO NOT INSTALL it in the database called postgres.`... That's exactly what I did though...

346,<@Thomasina> Might be a question for <#C3X4T24LB|databases>
347,"Hello Pythonistas,
anyone would know why `mimetypes.guess_type('my_file.csv')` returns `('application/vns.ms-excel', None)` instead of `('text/csv', None)` like Linux does? The file does not even exist."
347,Maybe because the default software for it is `excel` and windows do some tricks; is it doing the same with an existing file ?
347,"Looks like it uses registry settings, and doesn't examine actual files, just filenames"
347,"Yeah, with an existing file the result is the same.; Looks indeed as registry settings. I thought that `mimetypes` was supposed to be os-independent... I guess I am wrong? I just assumed it that way."
347,<https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/mimetypes.py#L350-L351>; It's os-dependent :slightly_smiling_face: Like anything that windows touches
347,"What type a file 'is' can always be open to interpretation, unfortunately"
347,"<@Thomasina> with alot of these postgis questions yo have, there should be answers on <https://gis.stackexchange.com/>"
347,"<@Meg> Oh, yes, I check there and other places, but the supposed solution to the problem doesn't work for me. :disappointed:"
347,"oh, interesting; are you using 9.6 postgres?; and the latest postgis?; I've never encountered your issue"
347,"Yes, and yes. :slightly_smiling_face:; I run `SET search_path TO public, sml;` which is generally the solution presented but I still receive the same error.; I don't, however, receive this error when running queries on the default `postgres` database. Only on this new one.; And I've confirmed that postgis is on the public schema as well"
347,"so, if you use something like pgadmin; and open up the tree down to your new database; so postgis is in your db extensions?; also, what is your query you're running; usually when you get this issue with postgis, it means you're inputing invalid types in the function"
347,"Yes, it's listed in the extensions for the new database.; Um...; So I rebooted my PC for unrelated reasons and now it works.; Interesting"
347,postgres might need a restart when you install postgis
347,especially on windows; because you can't update certain files when the system is running; so you ether need to restart the service or reboot
347,"Yep - on Windows open up Task Manager, pick Services, find postgres whatever, right click, Restart"

350,"I would start by moving it all into one function, which gets called once. Then I'd move parts of it into various individual functions based on grouping lumps of shared functionality together.

351,I'd also consider ditching things like `range(len(target_column_G))` which is usually the wrong way to iterate over something in Python

351,Thank you; <@Meg> Do you have any other notes other tha what <@Gabriele>  mentioned?
351,"he covered everything, I think; and i'd use some blank lines for separation; for bits that really don't belong in a different function; group variables together by general area of responsibility"
351,"The problem with learning the right way to write programs is that a lot of it doesn't make much sense until you've gone through the process a few times; I'd say just start small, clean things up, write functions, then maybe write classes, and read through the Python tutorial to understand all the tools available to you"
352,So <@Gabriele> I should continue developing this and learning other simple functions then when confident enough I release another version with functions?

352,Ah huh; One function that has all the finding with all the patterns; And when writing I call the right one?
352,I don't know what you mean by that. The alternative would be to call the wrong one...

356,"day, yes; but not the current minute, second, hour of the request"
356,`datetime.now()` against a timefield will be date/time; `date.now()` may work; I think you may need a between query for start/end of the day
356,You think it's best to create a `.env` file for the user and give an example or create one if one does not exist in the directory and write to it?
356,"The standard is `.*rc` files, so I usually use `~/.foorc`; At least on linux"
356,"<@Beula> Yes, I need implement `between` too, but first need to implmenet for current day, 2 minutes, I’ll try"
356,"Well between start of day and end of day is ""current date"" - which is what I am getting at"

359,"Hello,

I would like to test a system with several AMQP consumer/producers that are exchanging messages with each other.
I would like to have unit-testing with those consumers. Is there a commonly used design pattern for doing so in Python? (I'm using pytest at the moment with a fixture that look like this:; At the moment my set-up is this:
My consumers inherit from multiprocessing.Process and when started set-up their AMQP environment.
When the test is finished, the terminate closes the connection and cancel everything.
The problem that I get is that even when a test completed, the Process of the consumers seems to continue running in the background even after I called terminate.

How could I have a nice clean-up when the test is over? Would it change something to have BlockingConnection instead of a SelectConnection ?

Here is the current version of my base class for those components: <https://gist.github.com/sieben/caf39e04a83c812550d967a22b9d8584> is an obvious flaw in it? Is there an alternative from inheriting from Thread or Process ?"
360,Is there any way to run pycharm in debug with commandline arguments?
360,yes
360,"Yeah, you can use the same run menu with command line args and click the debug icon instead of play - or are you seeing something funky?"
360,go to run configuration
360,Is it under the script parameters
360,Yep; those are the args passed to it
360,Got it; I'm using a module called `simple_settings` and after a few times of accessing the configured settings I get; lol; But the stack trace pretty much shows all calls to the `simple_settings` module and I really don't understand why. I think I may just not use that at all to be honest. But wasn't sure if it was a mistake I made; It seems to be going between these two
360,well the stacktraces is pretty explicit; python as a recursion limit that you reached
360,"Yeah, I guess maybe I didn't actually setup the module properly; But it's odd that it goes between the two over and over I'm trying to get to it in debug"
360,well in fact the `__getattr__` func call `setup` and `setup` call `__getattr__` so it's endless
360,cant even debug to where it breaks
360,well it breaks as soon as the class is init or called; as `__getattr__` is used quite a lot
360,"Yeah, looking at some stuff now it basically says if `__getattrb__` can access a variable which does not yet exist it will go into infinite recursion; alright got rid of the module, not sure what was happening, figured out a different way"

364,<@Hermina> In my opinion it's better to add only depends that is needed by your project and leave pip decide what else should be installed.
364,so you mean we should avoid pip freeze?
364,I mean what I say)
364,haha alright
364,"what kind of project are we talking about here?  if it’s a library, you’ll want to avoid being so specific.  if it’s the end product, you’ll definitely want to be freezing your dependencies to exact versions"
364,in both cases i would say to freeze all dependencies with `pip freeze` anyways and then put `pip list --outdated` as part of your continuous integration process to let you know about newer versions
364,"I think it’s problematic for a library to specifically require a version of its dependencies, since unlike say npm Python dependencies are global; I’m pretty sure if I have two dependencies, A and B, which both depend on C, and they specify different versions of C, there is going to be a problem, right?"

369,dict keys are strings; so I suspect its your key identification that's ht eissue

371,"well, technically keys are hashes; string hash, I believe; but I was wrong; to be used as a dictionary key,

374,"Does anyone use `configparser`? Pretty sure I've asked this before, but just wondering"
374,I usually use `yaml` for configuration
374,i’ve used it before. it’s pretty nice. i also like yaml.
374,"I'm just trying to figure out if it's best practice to grab data for each variable with the configparser module individually like when needed, or setup something like `glob.py` and set them all at once in there"
374,configparser is ini files so if your used to microsoft world its less parity.
374,Because it seems that when you're compiling if the object that holds all the config stuff doesn't exist and you attempt to import them into some sort of globals file you get errors; so I'm trying to see what most do; Like should I grab the values and set them as attributes as part of classes/objects; <@Johana> <@Ciera> are you just using `pyyaml`?
374,yeah.
374,"so I can essentially just load in the yaml, store it in a settings variable and import the settings variable everywhere"
374,exactly. You might want to perform some check on it or put some default value but yeah that's the idea
374,i think pyyaml is the defacto.
374,just be careful the import is `yaml`
374,got it.; should I use the `- item` or `[item]` for a list?
374,Personally I prefer `- item` but depend if you have a long list I guess
374,okay wow this is insanely more simple; is there a reason to maintain a globals file for any reason with the yaml
374,depends what you want to be user configurable or not
374,I think I'm gonna just leave the .yaml file for someone to add more items to if they want to configure it any more. I'm gonna use `tkinter` to make dropdowns to select an item from lists

So without using `lambda` I get an error because the key does not exist within the dictionary; But I also need to run more than one single expression; How can I reference something that does not exist?; It sucks because it works with `command=lambda: ` but with a `command=func` which I sort of need because I need to grab some data from the fields when the button is clicked."
385,Look at `functools.partial`
386,You can make a partially applied function and delay the execution; Is the function invoked right away though? Either one seems like it should fail
385,Well here's what happens; So I have a main root for my application
385,&gt; It sucks because it works with `command=lambda: ` but with a `command=func` which I sort of need because I need to grab some data from the fields when the button is clicked.
385,"and I have 3 classes, one for each different ""page"" which are all `Tk.Frame` objects"
385,"`lambda: func(button1.text, button2.text)`?"
385,"Now in order to show the next frame after a submit button I have to have the next Frame available and already initialized. However in order to initialize the Frame which I want to show I have to also create that function that runs on click which requires the next Frame to also be initializied, but it hasn't been initialized yet because the first one is still being initializied lol; Slightly confusing I will show code"
385,"wait, lambdas ""execute"" when you access them; i.e. `lambda: func(x)` - `func` won't be called until you click the button"
385,"There is basically a `dict` with `Frame: Frame obj`; When it hit's the Repos Frame, it gets to this function; `self.submit = Button(self, text=""Submit"", command=submit(self, controller))`"
385,Neither will a function though
385,which breaks at the last line; With a key_error
385,"`Button(self, text=""Submit"", command=submit(self, controller))`; here you're not saying ""call `submit` when clicked"""
385,let me try `lambda: func()`
385,"you call `submit` and return a value, and assign this value to `command`; wut; here's a piece of code from a project of mine which uses Tk:
```
self.master.after(timeout, lambda: self.update_treeview(treeview, data, timeout))
```; the same principle"
385,It works
385,:slightly_smiling_face:
385,"also `lambda: func()` works. Should have just done that....; <@Suellen> since it seems you've used tkinter, what's the best way to go about passing data to another Frame. I'm trying to grab a selection and place it inside a label to show a user what they selected, but in the same way as before it places the default value into the label instead of grabbing the updated one."
385,If `lambda: func()` works just `func` should also work...
385,But it doesn't that's the thing lol
385,"Lambda is just a function reference, without a name. so setting `lambda: func()` is the same as `func`; Sounds like some other error, but if it works that's good :smile: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
385,"It's because it, for whatever reason attempts to access a key in a dict that doesn't exist and it steps into the function i attach to `command` if I just do `lambda: func()` it doesn't actually go into the function til it's finally clicked"
385,"<@Beula> `func` and `lambda: func(foo, bar)` are different :wink:"
385,"Which is why I recommended using a partial as an alternative; Anyway, in tkinter you see a ton of `lambda: thing()` so it't not out of the norm :smile:"
385,"<@Myong> can you show a bit of code? maybe it's something obvious; nooo waaay; you, mister, should have a cup of coffee :coffee:"
385,"I actually got it; I just pass the controller in, grab the dictionary of frames and get the variable from the corresponding frame; But this is quite annoying :slightly_smiling_face:"
385,"That was my experience with most desktop ui programming, it's a little funky what you have to do"
385,especially since Tk is sooo barebones
385,I just need 4 screens; that's it
385,there's a good side though: you better understand what happens under the wraps in other GUI frameworks
385,"god is this bad; Should have just made a frontend, honestly; just attempting to format this is so bad."
385,"That's a bit rude, but I challenge you to show me how this case above is not the same, vs just saying it's not. Here is proof it is:

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...    print(""foo"")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = lambda: print(""bar"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar()
bar
```

You can pass around `bar` or `foo` to any function that needs a callable (with no args in this case); ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(foo)
&lt;class 'function'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(bar)
&lt;class 'function'&gt;
```"
385,"something like this, in a 2x2 grid?; rude? man, I specifically joked about a cup-of-coffee so that doesn't seem rude :disappointed:"
385,&gt; nooo waaay
385,"I legitimately just have two frames of a 2 labels, a dropdown and a button"
385,Is what I was referring to
385,and I can't get them to do anything lol; Format wise
385,&gt; You can pass around `bar` or `foo` to any function that needs a callable (with no args in this case)
385,"this is actually what I should have showed

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...     print(""foo"")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = lambda: foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar()
foo
```"
385,"Yes, you're right 100%; but"
385,effectively foo and bar are the same here
385,"tkinter callbacks don't accept arguments, they are all callables compatible with `lambda: x`; but you almost always need to pass something that takes a whole lot of arguments"
385,This talk wasn't directly about tkinter
385,therefore it's a common pattern to hide the stuff that you actually need to do behind a simple unassuming lambda
385,"that was the general context, but not to my comment about `lambda: foo()` and `foo` being the same"
385,alright I got it. Now I need a progress bar.
385,alright then :slightly_smiling_face:; we're both wrong and right in 50% of contexts :slightly_smiling_face:
385,"solve one problem, another pops up"
385,tkinter.ttk has a progressbar widget
387,:stuck_out_tongue:
385,"I was being too literal, my apologies (sorry, had to run into a quick meeting)"
388,^^ Could anyone explain what I’m doing wrong to get the error there?; i have a feeling it’s just a weird typo that i’m not seeing
388,I’m noticing an immediate syntax error
388,can you even use comments in a dict?
388,"`replication ,` can’t happen"
388,"you mean `replication, `?  or am i missing where there’s a space?"
388,shouldn’t it be `replication:`
388,oooooh yes
388,"yeah, in your second dict in the list"
388,thank you for the eyeballs :smile:
388,should be `'replication': { ...}`
388,^^
388,facepalm :stuck_out_tongue:
388,you have it in two locations; both `replication` keys
388,fixed!
388,:boom:
388,duhhhhhhhh
388,sometimes its the little things; and things like this is where using an editor or IDE helps; because it can check your code for syntax validity as you write it; not so much with the shell or ipython
388,"<@Meg> actually i use vim with syntax highlighting and it runs flake8 on everything when saving, and somehow it just decided i must be trying to do some other valid thing in python; at least my test suite figured out it was a problem :stuck_out_tongue:"
388,"oh, interesting; :slightly_smiling_face:"
388,test suites FTW
388,so flake8 said that was valid python?; interesting
388,yeah idunno what it thought i was looking for
388,you may want to write a bug report about that on their gitlab; include that dict structure as an example
388,that’s not a bad idea; worst case there really is some half valid reason for syntax like that and they close it
388,"yup; don't see anything on the tracker about dictionaries that applies; so, maybe an edge case?"
388,<https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/353>
389,Finally finished this stupid gui. It should work
388,omg it works

390,"Hey everyone. I need some help with django, particualrly behave-django. I have some tests, some of which are dependent on there being some entries in a specific table. I thought Django would run migrations when it sets up the test database and created one but to no avail. I'd like to know if there's a way to add those table entries after the test database has been created. I'm using DRF."
390,You may want to ask in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> <@Hattie> instead of here
388,"Cool, thanks."
388,Anyone update PyCharm in the last couple of days and have your colors change?
390,I don't think function names were colored before.
390,Mine have been for as long as I can recall - but maybe it accidentally overrode your config
390,"It looks like many of the colors changed a bit. I don't remember what color functions were, maybe they were highlighted, but it is different. The TODO: colors also look a little different."
391,"has anyone used the attribute ""placeholder"" when using pyramid and deform?; I need to add a placeholder to a field but Im not actually coding an html page. so this would need to be done while constructing the schema of the table fields"
390,<@Meghan> yeah my colors got changed too
390,<@Ciera> Are they easy to change back? I think I liked the old ones better.
391,Yeah color are easy to edit. But you need to figure out what they where before. I launched the previous version and compared some
391,"Oh I guess I am on the EAP, I guess mine have been _different_ for a while :facepalm:"
391,Mine were changed with 2017.2
391,"I tried the IntelliJ theme, I can't stand it, it's too bright and the colors don't stand out much."
391,I use darcula with small modification 
391,"Yeah, that's what I use. Only issue I have with the prior to this week colors is that I want multi-line TODOs.; That's more of how it parses those than the color though."
391,multiline todos would be nice - have you had that working before?
391,I haven't.; Just something I would like to see.
391,"Aww, I thought you were about to make my week!"
391,"It would be something worth requesting, I would think.; Maybe I'll offer to pay for a year if they add it."
392,"Appreciate any help to point me to the right direction, not familiar with os class, how the files look like is in the comment :pray:"
392,"`if f.filename in os.listdir(dir_name)`

391,"yeah.. this works for me if I have zip file that extracts to csv if csv not there. But print ""csv-filename already exists"" if csv w/ same same already exists."
392,"Thanks! This is what I have so far, not working as I thought it would be, instead of file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_1, file_b_2. It gives file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_3, file_b_4"
391,"update line 1 to:
```
import os
import os.path
from zipfile import ZipFile
```; this `zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(file_name)` to `zip_ref = ZipFile(file_name)`"
391,"quick question assume I have a list `[""abc"",""ab"",""cda"" ..]` I want to remove all elements that are substring i.e. in this case it would be `[""abc"",""cda""]`; what is the quickest way to do that?"
391,len?
391,huh?
391,<@Thelma> what have you tried?; We like to see what you've tried before just giving answers :)
391,"```for e in li:
any([ x in e for x in e if x !=e])
```"
391,<@Jed> moving our convo as comments/thread into your last code snippet
391,"You want a substring, right? So I'm not sure a `!=` makes sense ; Try `in`"
391,I have that as well; just ensures it doesn’t check the same element
391,"<@Jed>  here, actually"
391,"Also any returns a Boolean, aren't you trying to remove from the list?"
391,from zipfile import ZipFile doesn’t work actually. I’m using Python 2.7
391,"Or filter it down, rather "
391,"So make these changes. Also, what are you trying to do w/ i counter/index in lines 12 and 19?"
391,yeah that would just be a filter and I would add it to a list
391,"So is it working, or are you trying to make it faster/more efficient?"
391,make it more efficient
391,"basically there are 3-5 files in each zipped folder: file_a, file_b, file_c, file_d

I wanted to make it so that the filename would increment, file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_1, file_b_2"
391,"so there is a conflict w/ i here.; on line 12 you initialize it to 0.
on line 13, i takes values 0 to len(zip_ref.filelist)-1 (automatically incrementing it's value as f gets a new element value from zip_ref.filelist; so list [""cat"", ""dog"", ""bird""]
i=0; f=cat
i=1; f=dog
i=2;f=bird"
393,"just to be clear, this happens automatically when you `for i, f in enumerate(pet_list):`"
391,ah makes sense didn’t notice it; getting a KeyError: “There is no item named “cat_0.csv” in the archive”
391,"yeah. So basically what you are trying to do is change the name of the file inside the zip and then unzip, right?"
394,yeap!
393,"right. so what is happening is you are only updating the name of the list, now the name of the file, inside the zip, on the HD."
394,"Check this out: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3982034/how-can-i-extract-files-using-custom-names-with-zipfile-module-from-python>; looks like unziping to a tmp folder might be the way to go.; &gt; right. so what is happening is you are only updating the name of the list, now the name of the file, inside the zip, on the HD.
What I said here, is wrong. Zip file is one that is getting overwritten. NOT the files inside the zip.; so if there are existing files of `file_a`, it should create `file_a_0` and then `file_a_1`, and so on? It just keeps adding to file_a_watever-count and file_b_whatever-count, depending on the files that have already been extracted?"
394,anytime i open a file in pycharm it says loading … arggg. why does this happen when i have something really important to fix.
394,"file_a_0, file_a_1
or file_a, file_a_1
or file_a, file_a_0, file_a_1

are all acceptable!"
394,"yes... I saw that.; if f.filename in os.listdir(dir_name):
                name, ext = os.path.splitext(f.filename); <@Jed>; line 7 counts the number of files that start the same and end the same... this assumes that file_a_1, file_a_2... is sequential. If you get file_a_1, file_a_4, file_a_7 then just play w/ this. Also, had line 11 one indentation back so it was trying to unzip/extract file from previous iteration, that were the file not found error coming from"
394,hmm it still only opens the first 2 zipped folders and line 10 is giving me RunTimeError: Attempt to read ZIP archive that was already closed

395,"Hey, could I get some quick help from someone? No idea how to explain the situation"
394,Essentially calling a function from another file doesn’t seem to work the same when you call it from inside another function
395,Is there any reason why these two calls would act different?
395,line 2 vs lines 4-6?; lines 4 through 6 won't execute unless today_posts is called from somewhere.
395,"Yeah, I get that :slightly_smiling_face:"
395,ok
395,"I’m calling the function, but the call on line 6 acts differently; Do you know much about the Telegram API wrapper telebot?"
395,"no, so I'll let it go for someone else."
395,"Okay, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:"
395,<@Graciela>: at a flance the only difference is that `db` and `c` are both scoped outside the context of the function so they could have different values each time it's called
395,"Hmmm okay; Any reason the above wouldn’t work?; <@Marcie>, sorry to tag you :slightly_smiling_face:"
395,"that looks legitimate, what behaviours are you seeing?"
395,"Essentially the sql doesn’t execute, but the function is defo called, I’ve put print statements everywhere and they all execute; But if I move the sql statement out of the function and hard code args[0] then it all runs; The function is called when the bot recieves a command on Telegram; So the way the wrapper is coded is the only thing I can think of"
395,is the logic that creates the cursor `c` called each time the script runs?
395,"db = sqlite3.connect(‘…’)
c = db.cursor(); db and c are created once at the start of main.py"
395,<@Graciela> try putting your `db` and `c` creation inside the `today_posts` method
396,"hi all, I am new (new to this slack and new to python) and have a question that is driving me crazy. could someone help?"
396,"Welcome <@Wendolyn> ! Go ahead and ask, someone will be along to help as they're available (no need to ask to ask)"
396,"the short story is that I'm getting `[Errno 32] Broken pipe` and I tried to use this solution I found on stack overflow ```from signal import signal, SIGPIPE, SIG_DFL
signal(SIGPIPE,SIG_DFL) ``` but just as was warned in the comments, that made the error go away, but my service just shut down instead; what I'm doing is this...I have two services, a main service for a website and a service for an api. My api gets some data from somewhere else and sends it to my website upon request.; when I hit the api directly, like through a valid route, I get the data and no error; but when I go through my website, which will eventually generate the same url and send a request to my api, I get a broken pipe.; both of the services are running on my computer; when I use the deployed version of the website (AWS), I get no error; only get broken pipe locally"
396,Can you produce a minimum viable example? Say just the two services running and the web one asking from the service one and failing? Abstractly it sounds like the web process is closing the socket - but hard to know
396,"ok...give me a minute to come up with an example, its actually pretty complicated. but I'll try to strip it down the the most important parts"
396,None
396,"I'm having a hard time distilling this into a code example. Maybe it would help me to just talk about it abstractly. If you don't mind? For one, what is a  socket, and what would cause it to close/how could I keep it open?

    to = [to]```; you should transform your string of emails ('<mailto:email1@mail.com|email1@mail.com>, <http://email2.mail.com|email2.mail.com>'), so that it becomes a list with each element being a proper email address"

400,"hi guys. anyone here know any solutions to having a python script create a list of objects parallel to another script consuming those objects as they are created?; i’ve got some test automation where each test requires a brand new account, but the accounts take anywhere between 30s-2min to create. i’d like to create the accounts parallel to the tests running to speed up execution time. i’ve found a way using `multiprocessing.Process` and continuously adding accounts to a `multiprocessing.Queue`, but this only works if that process is started from within the same script that executes the tests. i have a use case that requires the test execution to be able to consume a pre-made account as soon as the test starts executing, so `multiprocessing.Process` does not fully solve my problem, since the first test to execute still has to wait for the first account to be created and added to the queue; what would be ideal is a way to create a queue of accounts from a `create_accounts.py` script that i can execute at any time, and then be able to consume that queue at any arbitrary point in time _during_ or _after_ `create_accounts.py`"
400,an account takes up to two minutes to create?; :open_mouth:; no chance you can spend time trying to optimize that process?
401,"<@Suellen> That worked perfectly, thank you for the help!

402,tkinter is the mistake here :smile:
402,Just generates a report
402,"<@Meg> I would love to optimize the that process, but we’re working with a huge legacy app and optimizing the app itself is not really a feasible option without reliable (and efficient) test automation :disappointed:"
402,"I'd it's internal, bad ux for a little is okay"
402,I'm gonna just create another root and make a popup that comes up when the requests to the server complete; It is; it looks horrible
402,<@Beula> that sounds like what i’m looking for. how did you go about that?
402,"<@Ray> makes sense, gotta work with what you have."
402,exactly
402,"It was just a webapp, it would have a pool size of users it had to maintain, each time a test asked for a user I'd mark them as checked out and add them to a cleanup queue. That had a default time to live, but a test could ask for longer.; Then the test could edit the user if they wanted, add roles, etc; Our tests ran constantly and tons of them, so this was a Go application due to the load"
402,but not create user?
402,What?
402,ah ok
402,"It's not ideal to depend on an external service for tests, this was for the staging env"
402,"agreed. this is also for our staging env; i don’t envision the service being used outside of the tests, but i do need it to be able to be run independently of running the tests themselves"
402,I ended up getting an offer to move to Dev after that 
402,"oh yeah?; nice; we’re a mostly php shop, but atm all our test automation is in python, for whatever reason (not that i’m complaining. i like python better :smile:)"
402,"I've considered going back to qa to be able to do Python full time again; I've seen lots of ""QA Architect"" jobs around"
403,<@Beula> looks like `pyinstaller` doesn't work with Py3.6
403,Sadly true
403,do you have any other recommendation?
403,Are you using any 3.6 features?
403,That's what I was gonna figure out; I will say no; because I probably am not; is is good with `3.5.x`?
403,"Yeah, I have used it with 3.5 for about a year"
404,It works!! For some reason os.remove(item) is giving me error saying it's used by another process but I just have to delete the files. Thank you so much!
403,<@Myong> why not `pyenv`?
404,I believe what he is doing is trying to create a single executable to distrubute
403,oh.. right &gt;.&lt;; ignore me...
403,But do use `pyenv` to handle multiple versions!; Brew has caused me a number of issues when it updates
403,Unfortunately my time is up here next Friday so after that it's their issue :joy:
403,New job? Or was this an internship?
403,Internship; Back to school and possibly another internship; They may offer full time here but it's super Enterprise environment and not competitive pay; Plus another year of school I'd rather keep my options open
403,Definitely understood
403,It's all consulting stuff; Im one of the two CompE students here out of 35 interns and not even half of them are CompSci; Lots of CIS
403,you’ve had issues with brew and pyenv <@Beula> ?
403,<@Beula> should I just make up another `virtualenv` and put 3.5.whayeber on it then install reqs?
403,was it postgres? i had an issue and fixed it by upgrading psycopg2.
403,"Just `brew` managing my python install. For example when 3.6.2 came out and I updated, it killed a bunch of virtualenvs that were looking at the 3.6.1 executable; Sounds reasonable <@Myong>"
403,oh ok; yea i use pyenv now for that. the psycopg2 thing is the only issue i’ve had so far.
403,This work comp came with so many env variables in the path I can't add anymore :joy:
403,good old windows
403,<@Beula> have you noticed brew python being pretty slow overall?
403,<#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows>
403,seems it installs with some not very good flags that cause issues
403,where does virtualenv install to?
403,I haven't - but I write better code than you :stuck_out_tongue:
403,ooooo
403,<@Myong> on windows?
403,Well I mean is it inside python dir?
403,JK of course <@Meg> - I should benchmark it and then compile from source and see
403,":smile:; nice shot there, sir :stuck_out_tongue:; <https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/6i8dn7/python_276_via_brew_on_osx_twice_as_slow_as_the/>"

403,Oh man this is fun to figure this out
405,"trying to pull the database <http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/>
what would be the best bet in picking the database? PostgreSQL or MongoDB; I figured that there is a relation between the dumped data from multiple .txts which would immediately push me to use Psql but I wonder if Mongo can perform fairly if I am able to handle the co-relation at the app level with decent db-search"
405,"I’d do postgres; data is structured; and if you’re going to do spatial queries, postgis is the best option"
405,"<@Beula> got it all set up, gonna try pyinstaller; no issues with 3.5.3"
405,:toot:
405,That emoji must be 20 years old; Should I bundle the `config.yaml` or just place in the same dir or it does the same thing anyways
405,"if you want it editable, no"
405,"okay that's what I thought; yay no errors after 2 seconds this time; uh oh, the `.exe`just exits; yay"
405,You may need a special flag for a UI based app
405,gotcha; bunch of missing modules also; Seems like the main error are two of my module missing due to `invalid module`; Okay so inspecting the archive of my imported modules it does seem that I do not have the two modules; Im quite lost here. There's not much documentation on how to force a module import; And I can't figure out why the two modules are invalid
406,is this pyinstaller-related?
406,Yes
405,"I get a bunch of `Missing Module` warning s, but only two `Invalid Module` warnings for two of my modules imported in `main.py` and I'm not sure why they're invalid"
406,I've renamed them
406,"oh, I've never seen an invalid module thing; but for missing modules there's a `hidden_imports` directive; pyinstaller isn't very good at detecting what modules are used by a program :confused:"
406,I've even got it as a hidden import; Yeah I have no clue what the invalid module is; There is nothing about it; I can't find anything online
406,What's the module in question?
406,"Two modules, one uses `openpyxl` and populates an excel workbook with some data, another is just a single popup window for a notification that the file has finished being generated"
406,"oh damn, openpyxl"
406,Is that why?
406,"yeah, I spent a couple of hours fighting it"
406,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
406,"wait, does it compile OK and then the program doesn't work, or it doesn't compile altogether?; don't lose hope just yet :slightly_smiling_face:"
406,"Like the raw code? It all works, but of course without those two modules, or at least the openpyxl module it wont; Im gonna comment them out; only two lines in my project; and see what happens; building it now in pyinstaller; won't even run at all actually, just opens and closes"
406,run it from cmd.exe to see the error
406,okay; `Error loading Python DLL: C:\...\main\python35.dll`
406,welllllll that's something else entirely :x
406,oh wait was it this; Cause I saw something about this earlier; `_MEIPASS2 is NULL`
406,I remember there was some entity called `_MEIPASS2` but I didn't mess with it at all; <https://pastebin.com/Xihf4DdV>; My build.spec for pyinstaller
407,why is this needed at all? :confused:
406,I believe it's for `--onefile` flag; let me link to my python dir in `pathex`...; It's trying to pull python 3.5 dll from my build directory.
408,thank you <@Johana>
406,<@Suellen> should the python35.dll be in that build directory?; why is my specfile being overwritten every single time
406,there should be a single exe file
406,"I'm just trying to point the .exe to find the python35.dll; But everything I am doing isn't working; Well, may have found my problem; Does anyone have any clue why Pyinstaller chooses to overwrite my specfile every time I save it then run again"
409,the specfile is generated for you to edit and use instead of passing parameters to pyinstaller
409,It creates a spec unless you run it from a spec.
409,i.e. you create a spec and then do `pyinstaller main.spec`
409,Instead of specifying the .py file specify .spec
409,gotcha; Trying to add `python35.dll` to the dir; no luck
406,"`binaries=[('C:\\Users\\kybowman\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35\\python35.dll', 'python35.dll')],`"
409,Just another one of those days
409,Why would you need to do that? I didn't have to do anything along those lines to distribute Windows compiled scripts.
409,I have absolutely no clue; Not sure what else needs to go in there to not get missing Python35.dll; The dll is literally in there with the `.exe` and it's attempting to pull it from somewhere else; Found a google group post regarding `vcredist`
409,Are you compiling on Windows?
409,Yeah; I'm still wondering about the MEI thing because what happens is when I run it it says the DLL can't be found in c:/.../temp/pyinstaller/_MEIxxxx/python35.dll
410,Are you expecting it will be there?
409,No I am not at all; I have no clue where it gets that path from
409,"pyinstaller with the onefile flag should really be including that with it.; That path is where your files are extracted to.; ```
def resource_path(relative_path):
    """""" Get absolute path to resource, works for dev and for PyInstaller
     This is used to find included data files in pyinstaller version
    pyinstaller makes an environment variable? that has path to the included data files
    any hardcoded path should use this function as open(resource_path('/templates/my.template'))
    Do not use this for user entered files, such as the mcot csv or for outputted files
    """"""

    if hasattr(sys, '_MEIPASS'):
        return os.path.join(sys._MEIPASS, relative_path)

    return os.path.join(os.path.abspath("".""), relative_path)
```

This is what I've used to access included files, such as textfsm templates."
409,Where should this go?; Top of main file?; Or hook
409,"No, you use that in your open lines.; Example:
```
        with open(resource_path('templates/jinja2/evc-map.jinja')) as f:
            template = f.read()
            jinja = Template(template)
```; But, with your missing dll, something else is going wrong.; Have you tried to compile something simple to see if that works?"
409,Yes I'm using a simple helloworld.py script it works fine
409,"That's really weird. The only issues I ran into with pyinstaller were that it wasn't ready for 3.6 and I had to use the dev version, and with one of my tools for some reason it couldn't figure out the imports so I had to manually specify every single import."
409,"Yeah I had to downgrade to 3.5.3; Okay so given the code to grab the _MEIPASS envar, where exactly do I need to be putting the code within open lines"
409,"The function I gave you is if you need to open an included file. For example if you have templates or html you include in the package.; You can't use that for the python dll, because nothing is going to happen without that dll."
409,Yeah makes sense. But I just dont get this error at all. I've found so many posts on it in 2 hours and I'm just lost
409,How do you have pyinstaller installed?
409,through pip
409,In a virtual environment?
409,Yes
409,"Well, you could make a short script that prints the location of the MEIPASS directory then pauses for input, then go there and see what is extracted. I don't know if it extracts the dll file and libraries there or not though."
409,"something like print(sys.MEIPASS); oh man i might have got it. closing my eyes one sec; NOPE. sweet; Well I think i give up for now before I go crazy; <https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1566>
I'm giving up for now"

    while ret not in ('r', 'x'):

only when input in valid_results, continue through to conditional checks (`if user_input == 'a'...`)

413,It's in line 24 or 25 ; Under the books (selection) function; Oh I understand now
413,lines 31 and 32 are resetting the lists. The list of books and costs gets dropped down to original; lists when that function is called.; that call happens in lines 24/25
413,Right and I'm trying to figure out how to fix that problem
413,"change last line to
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
Move menu() in line 3 to line 2.
Break off the menu part into its own function where it outputs menu options text.
Look into how to pass lists to functions, as you are doing with `selection`"
416,Name? 
413,I dont have that anywhere
413,"Right now lines 1 - 3 don't really do anything. Your program runs b/c you call menu() at the end. Instead, call main(), which in turn calls menu(); Also, try this <@Susanne>"
416,"name is a built-in that is defined by the python interpreter (I'm jumping in late, but I think that's what you had asked)"
416,:point_up:
413,What does name do? 
413,this; It's an ugly thing that we have to accept lol
413,And that's it? That's a little vague; I use main to call functions menu and register 
413,<@Susanne> Here is the python doc on it: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html>; And a little more info from SO: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/419185/1584762>
413,"lines 1 - 3?
```
def main():
  
  menu()
```"
417,Well I just sent you the relevant code for the problem; I was having
417,"lines 145 and 148 (and I'm sure others in the code you didn't post) call main(). Are you also calling main() at the bottom near/next to menu()? No, right? Otherwise you'd get dup menu().; so try `if __name__ ....` to call `main()`.
and use `main()` to start you off and maintain control of flow/logic, and when to quit."
417,Ok I'll try that
417,"<@Susanne> This is just an example of how I've done this in the past <https://github.com/khdc-me/PracticePython_org/blob/master/Exercise032.py>
NOTE: There are a lot of things that I would change if I had to redo this game, but it can serve as a basic guide for what you are trying to do. Again, don't follow this outright, but use it for ideas."
417,so youre saying get rid of the main()‘s and just slap a if __name__ ==  “__main__” on the bottom?
417,no. scroll up to 11:30am. and read my reply to your previous msg; Also read this
417,Here is the revised code; <@Deedee>
417,remove line 167; did you look at the link I sent you to the 'example'?
417,Yes I did? so how are you able to call main then?
417,"it just does.; so this way, main() runs if this is run as a script... a stand-alone script.; like, you create a hello world and run it from terminal by `python helloworld.py`
```
def main():
    print ""Hello World""

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
```"
417,but I dont have scripts on my function Im using that function to call functions; but in raelity main is kinda of a useless function tbh; would you suggest getting rid of hte main functino?
417,"no; find a way to make it work, not just w/ the `main()` function, but through it."
417,yea its not working ill just stick to calling the main function normally; I really do not how you’re running it and its working? lol
417,careful. Keep it civil. This IS 'calling the main function normally'; I literally just copied and pasted your most recent code and ran it.; You're close. And having it all segmented into various functions is will make it very easy for you to make the small tweaks that it needs.; Stare at it... fight with it. It'll click.
417,Are you sure you are using the code I just posted on here?; 30 mins ago?; cuz idk man it aint clicking
417,"And I only did it to see if it would run, and if not... see what errors it produced. &lt;-- in fact, when you run it, what errors do you get?"
417,It doesnt even run I get nothing; I run and then it stops
417,"yeah, well I was asked a username and password and all"
417,I wasn’t at all
417,had to type that in then type it in again before it produced that main menu
417,maybe <http://repl.it|repl.it> doesn’t run if __name statement
417,"hahaha maybe. I can't confirm or deny. But if it doesn't work, then so be it... change 158 and 159 to just call main(). And ask someone why it doesn't work the way we're talking about here. Now, back to your original question... It's obvious that lines 50 and 51 are not the correct spots to declare the lists. Did you look into passing lists to functions?"
417,No I haven't; Well I believe i have been this entire time; Where would you recommend calling the lists?
417,"where do you think it should go? step through what you have, carefully. Did you write this out on paper first?"
417,No I didn't ; I was thinking about putting it after menu but before the books function and then returning those values; That's pretty much the one problem I've been having this whole time lol
417,"no. that's the only thing you asked about. There are multiple probs :joy:; like, line 129, type 'one' instead of '1'; lines 12 and 13 in register() don't make sense.; and much more. but one thing at a time."
417,Well 129 is just a print statement; So I can make it a little more clear if anything
417,109*
417,Again it's still a print statement; I'm deleting the list item by the index
417,"Line 109 says: `num = int(input(""Which book would you like to find?""))`; Line 129 says `num = int(input(""Which book would you like to sell?""))`; that's user input, not a print statement."
417,Oh my bad; Well that would work
417,"Lines 52 and 53:
```
  for i in range(0, len(inventory)):
    print(inventory[i])
```
should be
```
for i in inventory:
    print(inventory)
```
but `i` should be more describptive, like `movie_title` or whatever.; anyway... let's look at where you said you'd post the list; &gt;  after menu but before the books function and then returning those values
What would that look like?; Since you mention 'returning values', how does register and login work? In your own words."
418,It would allow me to use this values into another function when I call a specific using the return values as parameters
417,"how do you see that code happening? can you type it up here?; okay.. so I asked about this b/c that's not how `return` works; let's start building this bad boy.
I'm guessing the first step is that the user has to register, right?"
418,yea; they create a username and a password
417,so we'll start w/
418,the password has to be 6 characters or more
417,we'll move this into comments under that code snipet
418,"I need a register and login; Ok and I'm assuming we'll use it in a little bit, right?; ok; Im just trying to figure out which extensions to download for sublime; <@Deedee> You wanna move this over to the dm?"
419,<#C080T8XT2|job_board>
420,how would one who is used to MVC based web frameworks organize controllers in `aiohttp`. The closes thing seems like class based views but they cannot contain a RESTful resource. Or am I missing something?
420,"<@Fern> what makes you think they can't ""contain a restful resource""? Aiohttp is lower level framework, but you can design it any way you please "
418,how to do you access the key of a specific dictionary?; how do you*
418,"<@Susanne> Can you show what you're trying to get data out of? Normally it's just `dictionary['key_to_get']` to get the value out; There's also the view method if you want to see the available keys: `dictionary.keys()`; Is it line 5 and you are trying to check if the input value is in the books dictionary?; First, be sure to not override built-ins (`while str not in`, `str` is a built in). I also believe that you want `i` instead of `str` there; But you can just check `if key in dict: print('Yay, it exists!')`"
418,"but i isn’t going to print out; I ran the for loop but when I go to select I, I get ‘dict_items’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer"
418,"Oh, yeah you can't use integers in a dict - you are asking the user to give you an int and then looking that up in the dict; If you want to do that, you need to keep track of what keys the integers correlate with"
418,Thats im trying to do by converting it into a tuple; but i guess that doesnt work
418,"Dictionaries don't keep order until python 3.6, just an FYI - so that could work if you save it to a variable first, then ask for input; So maybe something like: 

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; options = list(enumerate(d.items()))
&gt;&gt;&gt; options
[(0, ('Game of Thrones', 50.0))]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i, (k, v) in options:
...   print(""select"", i,"" for "", k)
...
select 0  for  Game of Thrones
&gt;&gt;&gt; options[0]
(0, ('Game of Thrones', 50.0))
```; Actually in that case, probably better to just do `options = list(d.items())` which will give you a list of tuples, then from there the `i` value is the array index"
418,‘float’ object is not iterable; that was the error I got
418,Looking <@Susanne>; just a minute
418,ok
418,What line is the error in the stacktrace <@Susanne>; `enumerate(options)`; sorry
418,ok then what would I put if I wanted to print out he key and value?
418,How about you tell me on that one :slightly_smiling_face: Try it a bit and then report back if you are stuck; I don't want to give you too many answers to prohibit you learning it :slightly_smiling_face:
418,I would continue using options correct?
418,"Yep; You can grab it from options, which is a list of tuples `[(key, value)] -&gt; [(""Movie Name"", float_val)]`; So `options[i][0]` and `options[i][1]`"
418,"It says “list indices must be integers or slices, not str”; thats the snippet I ran"
418,The question you need to ask yourself is which thing in that snippet can give you a string that is used in `options`?
418,the str function
418,You aren't using the `str` function; The issue is that you are passing a `str` as an index
418,can you use int?
418,"That's what you want to use in a list :slightly_smiling_face:; Check this doc on `input` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input>; &gt; The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string"
418,ok; Now how would validate the input?; at least what would be the thing I am looking for in the while statement?
418,"I'll leave that to you for a little to try out, let me know if you hit your head on it too long"
418,hint at least? pretty please with sprinkles on top :smile:
418,"You have a list of things, you need to make sure the input is in that list :wink:"
418,while i not in range(options)?
418,Test it out; the nice thing about programming is you can test theories pretty easily :smile:
418,that is true; I got this “‘list’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer”
418,And which thing in that is a `list`?
418,"<@Denna> <@Beula> (sorry for the days-late response). Yes. My app is in installed apps and the admin panel is fully accessible and usable, but with the generic user model"
418,the options; correct?
421,I Want to learn python can any tell me where to start?
421,"<@Dennis> What's your programming experience level? Are you fully new to programming, or know another language?; Because `i` is set to the last index in the loop because python has function scoping, meaning that any variable defined within the function body (even nested scopes) will be available in the function.

It appears you need to use `num` rather than `i` to get the value from options"
418,"right I got it figured out; When I run the menu
I enter my command do the selected function

418,"I have a config file where; I update the settings as a user enters their choices; And in one part I have 3 separate lists a user can choose from, but the way they choose the list is by the title of the list; then in tkinter on the next screen, the appropriate list shows up; However, in tkinter since it builds each frame before it runs, it doesn't get filled with the user selection; and it doesn't like that I want to wait for user input before filling up a `OptionMenu`; so I was thinking that on submit of the screen before, I could simply access the next Frame before it appears, clear the list, and populate it with the correct values; But I wasn't sure if there was a less annoying walk around?"
418,Sounds like you need to wait to build the GUI until after the input has happened
418,"Well if that were the case, in tkinter I would need multiple mainloops because all the Frames in a single mainloop are built before any single Frame shows to a user; And multiple mainloops means multiple screens; Guess I just chose a crappy GUI framework to begin with, compared to the rest at least...; I'll go ahead with the manual option"

426,Hey <@Beula> what's a good substitution for the `f'{datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}.xlsx'` formatting; Can't use it in 3.6
426,"`""{:%Y-%m-%d}.xlsx"".format(datetime.datetime.now())` I think; let me double check; ```

427,So is `mytest-module` a module you created I'd imagine
427,correct
427,any modules or `.py` files should only use `_`; no `-`; because the `-` is not a proper identifier
427,figured it was that -- but i wanted a 2nd opinion
427,No problem
427,"The syntax for importing modules like that is `__import__('my-module')`, but as <@Myong> said, use `_`"
427,^
427,"tbh .. not sure how the hyphen made it in there, it's nowhere in the package."
427,"generally even underscores aren’t PEP8 compliant: “Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.

When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented) interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore (e.g. _socket ).”"

432,sure thing
433,"So, I've been using `__all__` for some time now to quickly declare to the programmer which functions of a module is to be used by other modules (more or less, when you open a file, the ""entry point(s)"" that other files that import this file uses can be found by reading `__all__`). It's quite helpful, but the problem is that e.g. sphinx by default won't add the docstrings of private functions. This makes sense if I'm writing API docs, but not so much if I want to cover all functions.

How would you handle this issue?"
433,`sphinx by default won't add the docstrings of private functions` there should be an option to activate it for all functions
433,Is that reasonable though? Maybe it's me who should rethink what the documentation should be used for.
433,<@Lanita> it's unusual to write a non-api documentation in the source code
433,"<@Collette> Why? If I write valid rst docstrings for private functions they can be used by other tools; I suppose that one of the reasons I care about this is that sphinx won't pass over my private functions by default, and thus I won't get any indication of rst syntax warnings/errors in my private functions, so they'll likely be broken and not noticed"
433,well in this case they shouldn't be private
433,"But sometimes the gritty details needs an explanation/overview, and that might as well be in rst, right? That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be private. Equating private with ""doesn't need docstring"" seems weird to me"
433,"I agree with <@Lanita> . Documentation isn't just for end-users; it's for coworkers. Or myself, in future."
433,"In my case, my sphinx documentation is 100% for co-workers that can code, and that will probably continue to be the case for some time.; But the thing is, my coworker might as well read the code to begin with, so maybe it makes sense to only declare the interfaces, given how readable raw rst is and python's readability in general..."
433,"I disagree; ""read the source"" is a poor substitute for good documentation"
433,I don't understand what do you want <@Lanita> ? sphinx to generate doc for private method that have docstrings ?
433,"That is what people *say*, but in reality, do people work like that? It's one thing to use a library, but when you're adding functionality to a codebase?; The reason I'm saying this is that my coworkers seem to be the people that prefers to read the source code directly, but maybe they're just used to an environment without documentation... sigh.; <@Ciera> I suppose I want a general discussion on how documentation is to be used, which I suppose would fit better in random. Oh well."
433,"<@Lanita> because api changes, but general ideas and core functionality often doesn't change"
433,"Source code and documentation go hand in hand. If I have documentation, I'll go there first. It also helps to communicate intent _far_ quicker than reading code does."
433,"Because when you try to express everything in __doc__, `help(obj)` becomes unreadable"
433,"<@Collette> , so you leave off private functions entirely in your fancy-looking documentation? (e.g. sphinx)"
433,"Yes. That's why they're private; I can include them into a ""how to read the source code"" guide though"
433,"<@Collette> that certainly seems like a sensible approach, and probably the most applicable to my use case. But it does push other developers towards ""read the source"" fairly quickly. Which I suppose is what is happening in my organization anyways.; So, defining __all__ in every python file is a reasonable idea, I presume? Any places where I shouldn't be doing that?"
433,"Well, you can't cover everything with docs. Sometimes you have to hijack the library and do dirty stuff. That's why I often write ""how to read the source code"" guides; But still, `__all__` is a must"
433,"Seems reasonable. Any pointers (blog posts, whatever) on how to write such guides? At what level should they be?; I usually use the top-level docstring to explain intent, and that usually includes mentions of both public and private functions. Though should I consider the top-level docstring to be public or private?"
433,"I put them in docs, not in `__doc__`. I try to explain the flow of a single successful request, how it goes from the entry point to the handler. And how you can hijack various parts of the handler if they aren't specified as the public api; If the intent of the library isn't clear, or the module names aren't obvious for a novice reader, I often document where's the entry point and if there is some private stuff that gets overridden by children classes"

434,"If the data is all being served up by Javascript then you can't scrape it. You'll want to watch which calls are being made to get the JSON data (or equivalent), and replicate those to get the data; Or ask Munchery if they have an API you can use"
434,"<@Cassaundra> also please check the terms of service of a site before asking questions about things that could violate TOS like scraping. The sites TOS is pretty clear on that, so your questions are better in <#C68GBADG8|etc_greyhat>"
434,<@Patty> Ok:+1:
435,"Simple one off question that I’ve thought too much about:
I made a website in Django that does a whole bunch of different things for me as a teacher, like gradebooks, assigning math problems to specific students, doling out digital awards, scraping the sites we use, sending parent letters, etc. When I describe it quickly to actual developers/programmers, what’s the easiest way to describe something like that?
Website? App? Program? What’s the usual term for a django site?"
435,"You're bordering on a ""LMS"" (Learning Management System) - but I usually just say ""site"".

In my anecdotal experience:

1. site/website -&gt; normal web application
2. webapp -&gt; borders on 1, but usually this gets more into more client side stuff, or an SPA type setup with an API and more functionality than the standard forms of a site
3. program -&gt; pretty vague, could be website, desktop app, etc.
4. app -&gt; often mobile specific

But given a little context anyone will catch your drift"
435,"Interesting, so teaching websites like mine have their own acronym? Good to know; Webapp is what I’ve been shooting for. Thanks! After making it for a year, I’ve only just started talking about it with people who know any coding and quickly realized I don’t know how to describe it to anyone who knows their stuff."
435,"LMS is a bit more, but sounds like you have a lot of one. Blackboard, Desire2Learn, Instructure Canvas, Moodle, all examples of LMS related sites"
435,"Yeah, I checked out a few and it’s definitely not at the level of most of those, but seems to have some overlap. :taco: to you, <@Beula>; Well I screwed that up."
435,<@Zaida> :taco: for solving a need for your work! Do you come from programming or pick it up for this project?
435,"<@Beula> Picked it up last summer to make my teaching more efficient/effective. But now I’m looking to learn enough to become a professional developer and hopefully work for an education based company, ala Khan Academy or the like.; Spent 4 years in the classroom, and a few in Graphic design before that, so the tech/design + education is something that I’m really interested in."
435,that’s a cool space to work in <@Zaida>. i work for an education based start-up. <http://openstax.org|openstax.org>
435,That's really cool!
435,"Whoa, Mike, openstax looks awesome."
435,<@Zaida> i would def. try to integrate with some LMS. for some reason it’s something that comes up last i don’t know why. we are currently making an integration with canvas.; yea we’re pretty cool. especially the fact that we make free textbooks.; we’ll be launching our first paid product this fall. <https://tutor.openstax.org/>; we’re a bit different than khan academy. i’ve met with those folks before :wink:. we actually publish research vs khan academy who doesn’t.
435,I love the entire concept of you guys.
435,Is that the flask app mike?
435,well i’ve blown up the flask app now but yea it was the personalized learning part <@Beula>
435,What is it now?
435,Do you see yourself as a ‘disruptive’ service? I know the price of textbooks has been a massive issue for years now.
435,"and Canvas is the best LMS from what I hear, but moodle is FOSS"
435,just pure python and api post requests.; yea we have been disrupted the market really good lately.
435,"Way to go, man."
435,"several big book publishers have partnered with us.; which is basically saying, “since they can’t beat us they’ve joined us.” lol"
435,"I teach 2nd Grade, so it’s a bit of a different world here, but still we have to shell out untold amounts of $ to pearson every year."
435,yea we tried to do k-12
435,And the user interface I make for Kindergarten-4th grade (that’s all my school covers at the moment) can’t be as complicated as a blackboard or a canvas.
435,we had another product called concept coach but the grant money didn’t come in; we had to pivot to college students.
435,Great demo to start with.
435,spaced practice is where its at.; and of course we have our own algorithms with academic papers written to compute the topic mastery of students.
435,"Oh! Do you know of any open-source algorithms for spaced practice? I’d love to incorporate something like what Anki uses into my app, but couldn’t find anything that I thought I could use."
435,i only know of anki.; i love it; especially since it is python
435,It’s fantastic. Is it open source?
435,ya; it uses a modified supermemo algorithm which is really good.
435,"Interesting… I doubt I can crack it open and make sense of it, but I’ll give it a shot.; Never heard of supermemo before."
435,i’m currently experimenting with spaced practice and unstructured information.
436,"I’m running into this in django but I think it’s a conceptual question that anybody can answer. I’m trying to write unit tests and in one of my cases, I get “myapp.models.DoesNotExist: MyModelClass matching query does not exist.” I can’t seem to actually access this exception in django and it does not seem like the parent class, “ObjectDoesNotExist” can handle this exception either. What other ways could I write my unittest for it to pass in this case?"
436,"It should me `myapp.models.ModelClass.DoesNotExist` and you can catch it; You should be able to do:

```
with self.assertRaises(ModelClass.DoesNotExist):
    pass  # test logic here that fails if no raise is received
```"
435,"This is for a 404, but similar idea: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website/blob/master/blog/tests.py#L91>"
436,<@Beula> I tried that too and it didn’t seem to do the trick.

&gt; When you use the thumbnail template tag sorl-thumbnail looks up the thumbnail in a Key Value Store. The key for a thumbnail is generated from its filename and storage. The thumbnail filename in turn is generated from the source and requested thumbnail size and options. If the key for the thumbnail is found in the Key Value Store, the serialized thumbnail information is fetched from it and returned. If the thumbnail key is not found there sorl-thumbnail continues to generate the thumbnail and stores necessary information in the Key Value Store.

I am not familiar with the lib, but it appears to cache all thumbs"

It kinda looks like 
```        def test_connect_non_vim_server_host(self):

449,"<@Meghan> Sometimes it's an ssl.CertificateError and sometimes it generates the Exception with the ""is not a VIM server"" message"

449,"You would put your function as one of the parameters there, and the expected result as the other.; ```self.assertEqual(add(1,2), 3)```; I suppose you will want an else clause, and in it put self.assertEqual(True, False) to get a failure.; With that though, can you narrow down what the exceptional condition should be so you know which exception it will give and you can test more accurately?; You could also use Exception rather than a specific exception, however, I don't like vague. If the two exceptions are related, that is one inherits from the other, or both inherit from a common exception, you could use that as well.; <@Kristopher>, I'm leaving the office, if you want to continue tag me so I get a notification."

450,hey everyone! i have a question in pandas about how to extract rows of a given dataframe based on a certain condition. So let's say I have a dataframe `table` and the condition is `bool_exp` which evaluates to true or false. How I can extract all rows of the dataframe which satisfy this condition?
449,"my attempt was this : `table = table[bool_exp]`; actually, `bool_exp` is something like this : `table['col1'].str.split('_').tolist()[0][2] in somelist`"
449,"<@Tameika>, do you want to extract rows based on boolean values of a specific column in `table` ?"
449,"hey kennes sorry for the ambiguity. every element of table['col1'] is : ABC_DEF_xyz_KLM. If `xyz` is a member of `somelist`, I extract that row."
450,"What is `somelist`?; typically, if you’re trying to perform calculations on `Series`objects, you can use `.map` so in your case `table.col1.map(some_function_you_wrote(value))`"
449,`somelist` is a list of string entries which may potentially contain `xyz`.
450,Ah I understand now.
449,Could you point to an example for map? I have a hard time wrapping my head around map and Series objects.
450,yes!
449,"To solve this issue, create a temporary column like so `table.temp = table.col1.map(lambda x: 1 if x in somelist else 0)` and then do `table = table[table.temp == 1]` then drop your `temp` column."
450,"ok, let me this try it out."
450,`x` will be the extracted `_xyz_` portion
449,true; dropping temp column :`del table['temp']` does not work?
450,"first, did you get the rows you wanted?"
449,"yes, I did the get the rows I wanted -- thanks!"

464,<@Sidney> I was doing this kata on codewars; <https://www.codewars.com/kata/55c45be3b2079eccff00010f>; my final solution ^^
464,try adding where the .so module resides to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
464,can you tell me what should I type into terminal; I'm newbie to Linux
464,"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""your path""; this most likely should be set in your bash.rc or equivalent iirc to persist; sorry it's been a long time since using"
464,if there is any spaces in the path; I think that causing some problems
464,use single quotes?
464,I tried; how can I know what is my PythonPath right now to see if the export worked or not
464,"python -c ""import sys; print(sys.path)"""
464,the new path is not there
464,because im not entirely sure how to help you here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18247333/python-pythonpath-in-linux>; looks like sound advice imo
464,"I didn't solve the issue yet , let me see if I can figure out what I'm missing; done buddy I copied the shared library to /usr/lib; appreciate your help :slightly_smiling_face:"
464,sweet :+1: you maybe coulda symlinked it too; might help incase it ever updates
464,its alread symlinked
465,"<@Staci> fwiw, you don't need the `key` in your call to `sorted`. What you have is the default behavior anyway."
464,"Yea I realized that after, I switched the order"
466,"Hey there. Does anyone know of a python 3 lib that can replace Gooey? Basically imagine if argparse opened a gui window and offered checkboxes, instead of reading switches from stdin?"
466,"<@Kanesha> have you seen <https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey/issues/65#issuecomment-313309037>; `If you're running Python &gt;= 3.5, you should be able to just pip install it and be on your way. All deps should auto resolve.`"
466,<@Kiara> Omg thanks. I missed that.
467,what should PYTHONPATH point to?
468,<@Tameika> you shouldn't touch it; Forget that exists
468,"ok, but I got this error. ``` /usr/local/include/boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:11: fatal error: 'pyconfig.h' file not found

```; same issues as here : <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19810940/ubuntu-linking-boost-python-fatal-error-pyconfig-cannot-be-found>; not sure where is pyconfig.h in my system either :disappointed:"
468,`find / -name pyconfig.h`; `find /usr/include/ -name pyconfig.h` is probably better
468,"yes, did that. its not there"
468,Have you installed `python-dev` package?
468,let me check; is it python-devel for mac?
468,How did you install python on your mac? Are you using built-in one?
468,i have both python2 and python3; i am using the built in one for python2 (currently working on that for boost python); i also did: `brew reinstall python`
468,"Okay, then you need to run `xcode-select --install` to install the development headers"
468,thats the whole command?
468,Yes
468,"`xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use ""Software Update"" to install updates`"
468,"By the way, re-using the pre-installed python is probably a bad idea. I'd go with `brew` version of python; Yeah, that's why"
468,"oh, how do i find if it is pre-installed or from brew?; actually i am not quite sure"
468,"If `which python` points to homebrew's bin, then it was installed by brew"
468,"ok, i found pyconfig.h is actually here : /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7; which python actually points to here : `/usr/bin/python`"
468,Then you're using the pre-installed python
468,shit; should I follow this and remove the entire framework <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22774529/what-is-the-safest-way-to-removing-python-framework-files-that-are-located-in-di>
468,Don't mess with your system; Also you probably haven't read the question carefully - it's about pythons installed neither by brew or system
468,"oh ok; so, what is the best way to resolve this and make my Sunday fruitful :neutral_face: ?"
468,Start from <https://stackoverflow.com/a/7375583>; Then try to include paths to the brew's python headers for cmake explicitly
468,"ok, I ran `which -a python` and understood that there is only one version of python at `/usr/bin/python`; so, either 1. i did not use brew to install python; or 2. brew installed python at `/usr/bin`"
468,What `brew ls -v python` says?
468,many files in `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/`
468,"Do you have `/usr/local/bin` in your PATH, as SO answer suggests? Have you read that answer?"
468,"yes, it has higher priority over others; echo $PATH gives me this : `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`"
468,Do you have `python` in `/usr/local/bin`?
468,seems to be linked files?
468,"yes, they're all linked to the Cellar; `lrwxr-xr-x  1 seanjohnson  admin  34  7 Jul 14:35 /usr/local/bin/python -&gt; ../Cellar/python/2.7.13/bin/python`; should just be a matter of putting `/usr/local/bin/` in your path then"
468,"yes, -- it is already in my path. `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`; still, i get the error ``` /usr/local/include/boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:11: fatal error: 'pyconfig.h' file not found
# include &lt;pyconfig.h&gt;
          ^```; any thoughts on why this is the case?"
468,"it's confusing as to why `/usr/local/bin/python` is not showing up for `which python`; though both the system and brew python should be able to find `pyconfig.h`; `/usr/bin/python-config` and `/usr/local/bin/python-config` should both return valid include directories that have `pyconfig.h` in them; like so:
```find $(/usr/bin/python-config --includes | sed ""s/-I//g"") | grep ""pyconfig.h""
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h```; ```find $(/usr/local/bin/python-config --includes | sed ""s/-I//g"") | grep ""pyconfig.h""
/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h
/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h```"
468,"Yes, I have the same output; ```/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h```; not for the second one; ```zsh: no such file or directory: /usr/local/bin/python-config
usage: find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ... [expression]
       find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] -f path [path ...] [expression]```; why is there no file : `/usr/local/bin/python-config` ?"
468,weird
468,can I just modify PYTHONPATH somehow?; that was my first question; but was told to not touch it
468,PYTHONPATH has nothing to do with your issue
468,ok
468,"yeah, it's the path for finding imports, your issue is finding headers for boost's C++ compilation; how are you installing boost.python domarps?"
468,"`brew install boost-python`; i went ahead and ran this command : ```export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=""$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7""```; and when I run make now, it gives me the following error; ```[ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/hello.dir/hello.o

469,that's linked libraries missing
468,"generally trying to shove these things from external environment variables tends to go poorly, you could try passing the output of `python-config2 --cflags` to your g++ command; though i'd probably advise reinstalling your python brew itself because something is wrong from the very start if your path is not picking up  `/usr/local/bin/python`; and just to confirm, this is trying to compile a program that uses python-boost, and not compiling python-boost itself?"
468,"yes, true!; just running Hello World from here : <https://github.com/TNG/boost-python-examples/tree/master/01-HelloWorld>"

468,"yeah that's your main issue then; there's output from `build.sh` that shows what arguments `cmake` is expecting; though there appears to be some stuff that the root CMakeLists.txt does for preprocessing some examples; `cmake` is smart enough to know not to recompile things that have changed though, so you can edit the `01-HelloWorld` example as much as you want and `build.sh` will only recompile the projects that have changed"
468,i see; let me re-do this from scratch

470,"good day mates, someone familiar with django signals here. I created a User object but i want to trigger my own signal function when after my object has been created and pass some additional argument do you have any work around with this."
471,"Hi folks, I’m working with uploadedFile from django, basically its just an file object. I need to check the file header before going any further process with the file.

471,Hi guys. You might have more luck with these questions in <#C0LMFRMB5|django>
471,"ok, thanks"
472,hi
473,Is there a go-to password difficulty validation library?
473,we use that at work. Not sure if it's the go-to/best one
473,"Well, being used in production is good enough, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:"
473,:thumbsup:
473,"If SO is a good source, there are some regexes posted for it: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/5142164/1584762>"
473,"Those are nice, I could even write most of them.. But if I learned anything at all while being an infosec student.. don't do it yourself :open_mouth:"
473,obligatory xkcd:; <https://xkcd.com/936/>
473,what's good with passwordmeter is the list of common password; can't do that (easily) with regex
473,Good point
473,I wonder if I could dynamically add current username to that list; some users really don't care about themselves
473,"I would make it a ""rules"" engine myself, test against the regex, test against the username, test against the first/last"
473,"Username: `tommyjones`
Password: `tommyjones1` -- strong"
473,test that it's not in the top 100 most common
473,best solution is auto generate password and don't authorise to change (or only regeneration) :smile:
473,Or no password and only biometrics
473,not letting users mess with passwords? I love it
473,"If you haven't seen it, NIST recently revised a lot of their password advice, some of the old wisdom seems no longer applies... Troy Hunt had a great writeup on it here <https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/>; The TL;DR was something like:

- Stop requiring periodic password changes
- Stop requiring specific formulas of what's okay to use
- Longer is always better and the best way to make passwords strong"
473,&gt; - Longer is always better; that's what she...
473,yup and the haveibeenpwned api seems like a very useful tool
473,Related is Jeff Atwood's: <https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/>
473,"specific formulas are no-go, alright, but what about suggestions?"
473,"I'm leery of the whole emojis in passwords thing, but maybe I'm just old and emoji newfangled :wink:"
473,"like, ""your password is rated 0.38 (or just ""weak""), and most common ways to impove it are: ...""; and make a suggestion to add numbers, symbols, increase length. But no checking for specifics, just for a resulting entropy"
473,"<@Suellen> I think the observation was that if you specify a formula, you're telling crackers the formula too. And since humans tend to work similarly it actually gives them a leg up. People tend to put capitals at the start. They tend to put ""special symbols"" and numbers at the end. Etc. If you just leave it free form then it is less likely those predictable patterns emerge"
473,oh
473,And they swap in numerals for letters sometimes -&gt; `Password1` -&gt; `P4ssword1`
473,"yeah, that makes sense, and that's exactly what I've been doing before keepass"
473,"The lookups are simple, lots of rainbow tables do that; But basically, require a length. For normal users discourse does 10char, for admins 15char"
473,"Where if you make the length arbitrary and encourage longer passwords, it adds a lot of cracking time. The NIST recommendation was to support up to either 128 or 256 char passwords I believe. It specified a minimum of 8, which IMO is probably low, but it's aimed at the average user, so..."
473,"and checking agains the 100,000 most common password"
473,"damn, 128"
473,"It's weird that anyone thought it was a good idea to start demanding special characters, because most people are just going to add 1 of them to meet the requirement, whereas simply making the password longer by a few characters would have a stronger benefit with no effect on how easy it is to remember"
473,holy guacamole
473,256 char passwords ? that require a password manager
473,If you want Jeff's suggestions (not the angry rant) -&gt; start here: <https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/#1passwordrulesarebullshit>
473,which is by itself a security risk
473,I think the idea is _up to_ 256 characters. With most online web apps you can just use a varchar or equivalent
473,good thing postgres doesn't enforce length on varchars
473,"Basically:

1. Rules are dumb
2. Enforce a minimum unicode length (emoji -&gt; 1 ""character"" in many length checkers... is the example)
3. Check against the common password (approx 30% of people have a password from the top 10,000)
4. Check of entropy 
5. Check special cases (containing username, first, or last); Just use TEXT with postgres :stuck_out_tongue:"
473,"<@Suellen> You hash the password so it gets down to a predictable, probably fixed, length anyway"
473,<https://stackoverflow.com/a/4849030/1584762>
473,I store password in JSONB :troll:
473,`varchar` without `max_length` is a `text` as far as pg is concerned; so that's good
473,"&gt; To sum it all up:
&gt; 
&gt; char(n) – takes too much space when dealing with values shorter than n, and can lead to subtle errors because of adding trailing spaces, plus it is problematic to change the limit
&gt; varchar(n) – it's problematic to change the limit in live environment
&gt; varchar – just like text
&gt; text – for me a winner – over (n) data types because it lacks their problems, and over varchar – because it has distinct name"
473,"although, why am I even talking about database types, when you shouldn't be storing them in the DB... let me get some more caffeine before I say anything else"
473,oh oh
473,"<@Ciera> NSCS/GCHQ (UK) is officially recommending password managers now, also mentioned in Troy's post"
473,"btw, since there's a great discussion going on: is bcrypt still good enough?"
473,<@Kenna> because they have access to them ? :troll:; am sure they are good but it's still a problem if someone get access to it
473,Yes
473,(even more in companies where you can just do a dump before get fired / leaving)
473,"<@Ciera> Lolz... but seriously my take is, if your adversary is a nation-state, you're probably doomed already... I ignore them and worry about the garden variety opponents... :slightly_smiling_face:"
473,`bcrypt` seems to be the standard still in most places
473,did you hear the sad story of scrypt? it's not the story infosec people would tell you...
474,what went on with scrypt?
473,"it was invented and named ""better bcrypt"", but wasn't used much; and starting to use scrypt now wouldn't make much sense because of argon2"
473,I was just looking through the django docs on what they use by default - and they suggest argon2 as well
473,"oh cool; wait, is there a python implementation / bindings?; I searched for it, but only found a lonely github repo and it wasn't updated much; `argon2_cffi`"
473,Looks like that's the one they link to as well: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/auth/passwords/#using-argon2-with-django>
473,must be good enough then; grrrreat
473,"&gt; . The Password Hashing Competition panel, however, recommends immediate use of Argon2 rather than the other algorithms supported by Django."
475,"Saw the password stuff from earlier. So much of the web, and business, is doing passwords so wrong. If there is a length limitation it is scary, because length doesn't matter much if it is hashed anyway."
475,or you're dealing with a crappy legacy system; and/or clueless management
475,"Length does matter with hashing, each additional character increases the hash entropy significantly - as far as I understand it; Sure the end hash is the same length"
475,I meant with storage.
475,Ah; ok
475,I want to be able to paste the text of the bible with emoji thrown in at random into a password field and have it work. :slightly_smiling_face:

So thinking on a course or tutorial."
476,"<@Donnetta>, I suggest spending some time learning how to navigate the graph API.

479,I am facing  one problem on Django framework that is In Django Models i want id is Autofilled but i don't want primary_key any one help me how to fix it
479,<@Verlie> you should post this in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> but the answer is primary_key=False
479,but i put primary_key is Flase it rise exception Autofilled must have primary_key = True
479,<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/models/#automatic-primary-key-fields>; sorry didn't know you meant AutoField; set another field to be your primary key explicitly sounds like what you're after
479,i didn't get you can you say clearly; we can put another key is primary Autofields not working; we can put another field is primary Autofields not working
479,"all models require one field to be a primary key, how exactly are you trying to use the autofield?; is this going to be your primary key because if so then it should be set as true not false; if it's not going to be your primary key then set another field as the primary_key=True but remove the false from autofield; the error is just saying it cannot be false; which is correct; read the link i pasted, it explains it much clearer tbh"
479,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37709163/how-can-i-support-autofieldprimary-key-false-in-django>; i go throw this link but its not working
479,"because you are using autofield django assumes you don't need to use it's built in primary key, create another field for id and set it to primary key whilst keeping your original non primary key, assuming thats what you meant"
479,"also, you may need to manually delete the pk index for the table; can’t remember if migrations will do that for you"
479,any sample code for how to do; i am new to Django
479,add a new field to the model class; with `primary_key = True`; delete `primary_key = True` from the autofield; run migrations; apply migrations
479,id = models.AutoField()
479,"this doesn't seem like anything that is worth doing imo, both field will contain the same values, whats wrong with just using the default PK field?"
479,good question
479,"first_name = models.CharField(max_length=15, primary_key = True); like this only"
479,_not_ a good idea; because a primary key needs to be unique; thats why its typically an integer or UUID; _why_ do you want the PK to be for the first name?
479,"cuid = models.AutoField(primary_key=False)
    cust_id = ""CUS"" + str(cuid)      (i want this field is primary_key)"
479,"the AutoField seems moot here, so does the cust_id field"
479,ya in cust_id we concatinating string and id
479,_why_?
479,"if this is not gonna be readable by whoever is using it, just use the built in PK field; a simple integer as a unique identifier seems much simpler"
479,don’t make things more complex than you need to
479,i want  cust_id field as primary_key and  cuid field is Autofield
479,"if you specifically need a str + unique id, still use the built in pk field and concat the name and id in another field; keeping it simple works wonders :slightly_smiling_face:"
479,can you plese write code related to what i am asking that way
479,because you are going about it the wrong way
479,here i apply inherritance
479,and what you’re trying to do is complex and unnecessary by any application of good practices
479,i am inherritting some classes that why i dint want id is primary_key
479,"that doesn’t make any sense; because when you inherit a model, you don’t inherit the id of the other model class"
479,but default it generate id on other classes
480,"^ Sorry for wrapping text in snippet, but its still readable i think.."
480,<@Danille> better luck in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> :slightly_smiling_face:
480,:smile:
479,<@Ciera> is it better to use Flask?)
480,they are very different. there is not a better one. It depends what your goal is
480,"<@Ciera> Yeah, I know. Django has batteries, i thought.. But turns out that there is a lot of unnecessary complexity for my tasks. Maybe I just don’t understand it :slightly_smiling_face:"
480,"conversely, flask doesn’t have many batteries"
480,I'm not a django expert but yeah django can be a bit heavy for some tasks
480,"but requires a greater level of understanding, I feel"
480,:point_up:
480,"if you’re familiar with web dev, django is pretty analogous to angular; and flask with react/vue"
480,For web I wrote only a small ROR project and it is was a nightmare compare to django’s “magic” :slightly_smiling_face:
480,haha
479,sounds like you and <@Beula> have similar Ruby love :slightly_smiling_face:
480,My ears were tingling <@Meg>. You summoned? ;)
479,"apparently so, genie; <https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/c/c8/Genie5.png/revision/latest?cb=20130719001923>"
479,"Apologies, but I won't break out in song and dance"
479,"thanks :slightly_smiling_face:; so you don’t bust out in moves, you break them completely?"
479,I think it is telling that the ruby dancce looks like someone crying
479,"Agreed, very insightful! "
481,What's the difference between os.environ.get and os.getenv ?
481,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16924471/difference-between-os-getenv-and-os-environ-get>
481,"Anyone have any issues with the latest requests package and connecting to SSL?; I.e., requests.get('<https://www.google.com>') gets a CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED error?; On an EC2 instance (RHCE) I get this with a clean venv with the latest requests (2.18.3), but not with a clean venv with a slightly older one (2.13); But on my Mac, clean venv with the latest requests work; Really weird"
481,It's working on my ubuntu laptop with `2.18.3`
481,"Yeah, like it said it's fine on my Mac"
481,maybe certificates that needs updating ?
481,Python on the EC2 is 2.7.5; It uses certifi for the certs
481,is it not a case of google's anti botting ?
481,"And I tested the cert file with openssl on the command line and it worked; I.e., it has a fresh cert file packaged - it doesn't use the system cert"
481,does curl work ?
481,<@Tandra> Don't know why that would only affect the newer version and only on the EC2 instance; <@Ciera> Let me try
481,if the ip has hit the url too many times it could potentially lock it out is what i meant
481,But openssl AND slightly older requests work
481,hence why it works elsewhere
481,for a request to google homepage I think you should hit it pretty hard to be locked out
481,Yeah; Curl works
481,well so I guess it's something in `requests`
481,Need to figure out how to get more info
481,I would try with newer python and open an issue :slightly_smiling_face:
481,"Need the raw request, I guess; Going to see if I can dump the full request"
481,"can you update to newer python?; I mean, 2.7.5 _is_ fairly old"
481,Yeah
481,try to up the log level; requests is supporting 2.6 so it should work
481,probs related: <https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/issues/52>; `requests` updated their `certifi` dependency @ version 2.14 (after working 2.13)
481,"Oooh, missed that issue; Yeah, my openssl is 1.0.1; Thanks!"
481,that would do it :slightly_smiling_face:
481,"Yeah, that did it"
482,yay :tada:
483,"Im need your help again :confused:
Anyone worked with gunicorn+djnago here?"
483,<#C0LMFRMB5|django> would be the best place to ask
483,"oh, ok, thx; Im switching back here :slightly_smiling_face:
Sorry for bothering so much

I live in Moscow, so I have utc+3….
Should i configure utc+3 for python, postgres and nginx…; or I can just leave utc everywhere?"
483,"<@Danille> you should always store and use UTC everywhere, up until you need to present the datetime to users; at this point it should be in their locale"
483,I commented on that in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> - there is some slight overlap in the subjects
483,I'm not subscribed to that channel :confused:
483,I should have suggested they keep it in one spot - my bad
484,"Hi, what's the best python IDE for a newbie?"
483,"<@Ela> notepad; A newbie should learn language, not IDE hotkeys and autocompletion stuff"
483,Agreed with <@Collette> . PyCharm is the most feature filled - but that may hinder learning
483,best place to start learning the python language is <http://python.org|python.org>?
483,i think the way it helps enforce styles and auto-completion is useful.; i started with an IDE and i’ve done a number of other things w/o it and have been fine.; “best” is a rather subjective term but i really liked the google 2 day class.; you might also like codeacademy. it’s interactive and in the browser.; the only thing about the google 2 day class is they use 2 spaces instead of 4. I didn’t follow that but as long as you’re consistent your fine.; <https://developers.google.com/edu/python/>
485,<@Suellen> thank u!
483,<@Johana> Thanks. Should I get the  Learn Python the Hard way book ?
483,Nope
483,we don’t recommend zed shaw’s stuff here
483,The author is pretty hostile toward the Python community
483,automate the boring stuff is one i can’t stop hearing good things about; <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>
483,It's free online!
483,you could also ask <@Collette> to be your personal mentor but i’ve tried and he told me to gtfo.
483,<http://pythonlearn.com/>
483,have we covered this in the learning resources?
483,idk
483,yup; <https://github.com/pyslackers/learning-resources/blob/master/topics/essentials.md>; <@Ela> :point_up:
483,<@Johana> I can be your personal mentor only if we talk in russian :slightly_smiling_face:
483,i need to learn russian quick.
483,Thank you guys
483,learning-resources seems a little light
483,what’s interesting is the tutorials out there from ppl who have not ever held a python job. that’s kinda interesting.
483,It's not been prioritized much recently
483,ah ok
483,well the community should be helping fill that stuff up. lol; one day
483,lol
483,Ideally!
483,did you use that site <@Orpha> ?
483,<http://pythonlearn.com/> ?
483,ya
483,So far only a few of us have been pretty active on the <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> - others come and go and add a little bit as they have time
483,its the site for a coursera class; python for everyone
483,ah i see the MOOC link
483,or something like that; but he updated it from py2 to py3
483,i think this is what a couple ppl from work are doing.
483,"and i added foundation to his site, it looks bad now, but it was way worse haha; i haven’t actually taken the course; i took a different one"
483,"nice license on his stuff too:

&gt; Note to people teaching Python: These materials are Copyright Creattive Commons Attribution 2.5. You are welcome to use these in your courses any way you like. You can make copies and host them yourselves if you like."
483,"but… hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken it; yea, and his book has been translated to many other languages from what i remember"
483,i like the intro to his book. i have an interest in this so its cool to see the different ways ppl start out their “why you should learn programming” introductions.
483,The Coursera Rice Sponsored Python track was good.; If that hasn’t been mentioned already.
483,o wait.. that’s probably the one ppl are doing at work.; i know it’s on coursera.; our director has a course on there too for signal processing.
483,I took that track 4 years ago and it was great if you dedicate the time.
483,i know b/c we use a lot of his seed data for experiments :wink:.; i did the edx MIT 6.0.0.1 and 2 course.
483,<https://github.com/csev/py4e>; ^ the repo for everything related to that course
483,"this one starts in AUG <https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11?utm_source=OCW&amp;utm_medium=CHP&amp;utm_campaign=OCW>; the instructor is awesome. he also has a python textbook.; however, i like the coursera interface more than edx.; SO MANY CHOICES !!!"
483,the edx interface reminds me of them clickbait links with 30 pictures each on seperate pages :neutral_face:
483,lol
483,Looks like we have some new ideas for our learning-resources repo
486,"yea, i’ll PR a few of these in."
486,I'm also hoping to finish writing this book on flask. <#C3GFPUBGF|shameless_plug> 
486,nice you have a flask book? you going to compete with the good ol’ miguel grinberg.
486,Likely not. lol; My book is pretty niche ; Sort of a how to put flask into production 
486,yea i had my own ideas in that area too. we’ll have stuff for the community at some point.
486,Nice 
486,i got an email about this today. it seems pretty good.; <http://python101.pythonlibrary.org/>
486,"That book does look good. I got a free copy when he gave it away on Reddit last year, and have bookmarked the link since he posted it online for free now."
486,haha i did the free copy thing too.
486,"That may have been how I ended up using ConfigObj for everything, I think."
486,soooo many free resources. that’s why i’m shocked when ppl pay for classes and they are learning on their own.
486,I know. And so many of the classes are outdated or poorly done.
486,for work i can see being sent to some training.
486,"I've been doing this for 18 months, I think, and that book still has things I've not done."
486,"humblebookbundle recently did a bunch of python books, can't wait to get stuck into them. the resources for learning are pretty awesome"
486,"i really liked violent python, but it was in python-2.x"
486,"i have that but haven't read it yet, does it matter if it's py2 specific?"
486,these days it isn’t a stretch to go py2 to py3
486,thats what i was thinking too
487,anyone here deploying docker containers on aws in production? curious how you're doing it. theres different ways.
488,"its not too bad. it would just be nice to copy code directly and see it work.; its actually not a problem for me at all; ill still code in 2.x; im slowly starting to write more 3.x now; but every time i tell <@Bruno> i got a new book, the first thing he asks is if its py2 or py3"
488,lol. mostly because of how stubborn you used to be on using 2. so now its more habit and amusing.
488,lol; back when i was mostly webscraping using urllib.. i didn’t like that i had to decode it in 3
488,you should just write your own version of that book in python 3 (with async of course) and make it forward compatible with python 4
488,no; lol; im gonna be just as stubborn about py4 (wtf is that) and async as i was about py2; lol
488,is there a big thing between py2 and 3 still?
488,"as far as i know, just a differences in the imports / things being bytes instead of strings"
488,not as much anymore.; theres more differences underneath. but most arent too much of an issue. unless you are Zed Shaw
488,"also, isn’t 3.6 when lists and dicts were ordered?"
488,yes
488,"i read the zed shaw stuff, he sounds a bit crazy imo tbh"
488,"dicts, lists are always ordered"
488,there were _technically_ ordered before. it just wasnt garanteed
488,yeah but better not based your code on that
488,^ thats what i meant
488,it's now garanteed but subject to change as it's an implementation detail
488,yea you shouldnt; yea
488,i don't know if they are in PyPi
488,yes they are; thats where they got the new code from
488,would there ever be a reason for it to be unordered ?
488,they stoled it
488,seems like a step backwards if that ever happens
488,speed I guess
488,speed should never matter though surly?
488,i think it was still an improvement if I recall
488,dict speed is pretty important as almost everything is a dict in python
488,it was always weird when id pull a random out of a list
488,since they changed other things or how part of the algorithm worked. i think.
488,it was an improvement but I'm talking about the future
488,yea
488,maybe someone will find a new algorithm much faster but that isn't ordered
488,3.6 has a ton of dict improvements!
488,yup.
488,yeah there are great talks from raymond hettinger about them
488,"they got a lot from pypy too. so hopefully, it will help them catch up faster"
488,if you are on 3.5 no reason to not use 3.6
488,hettinger has a lot of good talks anyways
488,with their funding pypi is improving a lot their python 3 support
488,yea. thanks to Mozilla.; they got intitial 3.5 support super fast
488,That's a company I would love to work with
488,same.
488,yeah but not sure it's financially stable enough
488,"i have heard redhat is nice to work for too. i technically applied recently, but never heard anything.; i dont think it is yet"
488,working on ansible :smile:
488,Mozilla has millions annually just for featuring Yahoo as the default search engine
488,heh
488,yeah but it's all based on donation. It can stop at any time
488,what % of yahoos income is that. lol
488,I think that one is contractually obligated for 7 years
488,its been a few years already
489,"Hi guys , what is the equivalent of   
extern Sdk*  Sdk_new2(const char * ip);"
488,this in C I need for Pyhton
488,i have no clue. im not a C guy.
488,i could guess but i won't
488,<https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html>; ^ you could always just use the c code
489,what you mean in that?
488,"You need to provide more context <@Elanor> , with what you've shown there is next to no context"
489,"Depending on what headers are imported, Sdk could be anything"
488,"I don't have any headers imported in Python , I only import shared libraries"
489,.so
489,"Okay, so what shared object libraries?"
488,That's context :wink:
488,In C++ the headers name is SDK; I'm calling function from this shared library
489,in Linxu
489,"Is this python C-extension specific, or something else?"
488,"The Share Library is already done by another person I Import it in Python and I need to use some function calls; he told me to use extern , but I don't know what that mean in Python"
488,can you point to the source of the library so we know what sdk is?; i think thats what he needs
488,this sounds like you need to import the .so into python and call a function right?
489,yes
488,If I can get the source I will provide it to you
489,but the function Name is Sdk_new2; and SDK is the Main class name; in C++
489,Sounds like you could benefit from CFFI
488,<https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>
488,"well, the name doesnt mean much. we need to know what it does in C in order to do similar in python."
488,"I don't think they are trying to recreate it in Python, I think they want to use the shared lib from python"
489,CFFI is the easiest way IIRC
489,I will take a look
489,ah yea. i was thinking wrong.
488,No what I'm going to do in Python just Functuon Calls
489,may have gotten lost above. but looking to see how others may be deploying docker on aws. either their container service or beanstalk or something else.
488,"We did Mesos, so using an orchestration system"
488,"ah. yea, rancher came to mind too.; i havent touched mesos"
488,"Kubernetes, Mesos, Rancher, Swarm - take your pick :slightly_smiling_face:"
488,the place im trying to get an interview with i guess is using docker with aws.
488,Everywhere seems to say that these days :wink:
488,or they want to. or something.; yea
490,"hi everyone, please advice a book to study Python 3 for BEGINNERS"

491,cross posting here -- <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45576378/boost-python-library-linking-issue-undefined-symbol/45578139?noredirect=1#comment78117846_45578139>
491,should I only ask questions in here if I have them?
491,"<@Steve> this is typically a place for generic python questions or if there isnt a more specific place to ask your question if it's about a particular library or topic (such as <#C0LMFRMB5|django>, <#C07EYDP25|webdev>, <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning>, etc.)"
491,cool thanks
492,if you have 3 files as follows : `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py27.so  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py34.so  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python.so`; How do I link the `libboost_python-py34.so`to `-lboost_python`?
493,"Hm, how terrible of an idea is it to use classes as a sort of symbol, instead of using an enum?

Something like this:

```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    class Symbol: pass
    class State(Symbol): pass
    class FireTheMissiles(State): pass
    class WaitAround(State): pass

    def perform_action(action: State) -&gt; None:
        if action is FireTheMissiles:
            print(""On!"")
        elif action is WaitAround:
            print(""Off!"")
        else:
            raise Exception(""Unhandled action '{}'"".format(action.__name__))

    perform_action(FireTheMissiles)
```; Stringly typed functions suck and there's no native symbols type AFAIK(?)"
493,"<@Lanita> your conditions are all wrong. `if isinstance(action, FireTheMissiles)` is the correct one"
493,"<@Collette>, no, I'm not instantiating the State classes; Let's make it like this or something:

```
    class Symbol:
        def __init__(self):
            raise Exception(""Shouldn't be instantiated!"")
```

...to make sure that nobody tries instantiating the symbols; a bit like how None is not callable"
493,`def perform_action(action: State)` declaration means that `action` is an instance of `State` :slightly_smiling_face:
493,"Ah, sorry, yes. Hm, is there a way to signify a non-instantiated class?; type(WaitAround) is `&lt;class 'type'&gt;` so I guess that'd be weird..."
493,why use a class for that and not a string or whatever ?
493,"ovv, an error in stringly typed code won't be detected until runtime"
493,"It's `Type[State]`, but I'd go with enums"
493,"with this, you would have some file symbols.py where you'd import all the ""symbols"" you're using"
493,is there no way to add type check for string in a list or something like that in mypy ?; jsut asking as I have nerver used it
493,"Ah, now I remember, the problem with enum is that until 3.6 there was no built-in way to automatically generate enums. Also, the syntax in 3.6 is really ugly either way"
493,Ugly? What's a better syntax?
493,"ah, after looking at it, Enum seems like a much better choice; malinoff, having one auto() for every new possible value is really ugly; The syntax is clearly a compromise for python not having proper enums to begin with; maybe something like...

sym FIRE_THE_MISSILES
sym WAIT_AROUND
StateEnum = SymbolCollection(""StateEnum"", FIRE_THE_MISSILES, WAIT_AROUND)

(assuming that this was implemented way earlier, of course). This would allow symbols ""on their own"" as well as a collection of symbols. Perhaps that might as well be a list though, it really depends on how you're using enums to begin with"
493,I vaguely recall using `WHATEVER = object()` in the past for this sort of purpose
494,Enum is new in 3.4
495,How to run multiple tests output  in a single class
495,?; please elaborate :slightly_smiling_face:
494,I will text u in pm
495,why not do it here?
495,Ok i am having an issue trying to get subprocess to print back a ping -R command
495,in the same shell?; what code?
495,"p = subprocess.Popen([‘ping’,‘<http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX|XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX>’], stdout= subprocess.PIPE,stderr= subprocess.PIPE)

out, error = p.communicate()

print(out); the XXX is ip; i just sanatized it; i just get nothing big fat nothing printed to the console"
495,does `subprocess.check_output(same_command)` output something?
495,"File “/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/subprocess.py”, line 618, in check_output
    raise ValueError(‘stdout argument not allowed, it will be overridden.‘)

495,"actually, your first code works for me :confused:"
495,"p = subprocess.Popen([‘ping’, ‘8.8.8.8’])"
495,could it be a OS X specific issue?
495,yeah idk i have had subproc work just fine before; I am trying to run a ping -R; and pring out the results; print
495,what os are you using?
495,OSX; but the target for this is Linux at the end of the day i think
495,might not have had -c 1 arg?; in original code; so it was timing out
495,"damn it; yes!; I haven't even thought about it; very likely the cause, as `communicate()` waits for the EOF or process termination"
495,yeah i got traffic now but i did not get the route print
495,is `-R` present?
495,indeed; and this is internal IP will do a route print; back; i verified in the term
495,does OS X's ping support that flag? :slightly_smiling_face:
495,it does
495,oh :confused:
495,yeah i can not provide you with the output but it does work; since this is deep inside a private network; but it does work; the command does print back
495,but not the route?

495,Hi Guyz
496,Thats my case ; Am trying run thats test case
495,Where instead of showing both tests output it only shows fail
496,What changes need to be done to get both test output 
496,"you need to define `test_software`, etc inside `class_unit_test.setUp`; because the unit test instanciates the class; so anything you do outside it, in the context of a unit test, will not exist; in other words, use `setUp` to define variables you need for the test; also, you need better naming for your class and variables"
496,And do i need to define multiple fuctions 
496,one test method for each piece you test

499,Anyone as an idea how to skip some unittest on older python version when it trigger a syntax error ?
499,"Could catch and pass the exception (or suppress), or put the whole thing in an if statement that checks the version."
499,I try the if statement but it's not working because it's a syntax error; it can't even import the file :confused:
499,"Oh, right, good point.; if version: import module; Though, if the script is to work on the old version, are you subbing in a different module for the old version? Otherwise shouldn't you want it to fail the unit test?"
499,the syntax error is only in the test; in the module itself I made an if based on the version
499,What is the syntax error?
499,it's for an asynchronous context manager
499,"You can check the `sys.version_info` and if it's before your thing do a no-op; aiohttp does dynamic methods based on version, I added some of these :wink:; finding a link"
499,yeah that's what I do but the syntax still need to be correct for the previous version
499,<https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/master/aiohttp/client.py#L583>

499,"In a class though? Oh, I can't imagine that not being ugly.

Perhaps inherit from the 3.4 safe class in the 3.5/6 class in the other file?"
499,yeah that could work
499,Isn't the 3.4 syntax just `@asyncio.coroutine` on the function and `yield from` instead of `await`?; why do you need 3.4?
499,yes it is but there is no syntax for `async with` (that I know of); I don't need it I'm on 3.6 but it was in the library so trying to not take it out

502,"i want the text one to be unique; (so pretty much act like an id); but still have a numerical id as well; empty db, insert ""a"", `(1, ""a"")`, then insert ""a"" should cause a conflict"
502,what flavor of sql? you can probably add a unique index on it
504,for example in mysql if the table is already created you could use (<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-index.html>) and if you are making the table then with the unique constraint (<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table.html>)
502,"postgres, hoping it applies to sqlite too"

create table table_name (

504,because then you'd change your code to the ORM in that language
502,I think the main thing is whether or not you would use the migration features of the ORM; but usually that's fairly separate anyway; for instance you should have no problem using sql-alchemy or pony with an existing database; even if you had been using that database with an existing codebase in a different language previously
502,hmmm; I have never done a migration and I always fear it; I always prefer to just delete the database; :confused:; it's a scary habit when something I make would hit production; I'd have no experience doing a migration
502,<@Jesusa> I have CI always run all migrations to make sure they are compatible

505,"if you want to find files matching a wildcard in Python, you could use the glob module. ```for path in glob.glob('foo_bar_cat_*_dog'):
    os.remove(path)```"
506,"ooo <@Leonie>, I haven’t seen `glob` used before. That looks l337."
506,there’s `iglob` too if you want an iterator; and I think in 3.5+ you can even have it recurse directories for you

        os.remove(path)

import os
rem_list = ['2', '4']
for path in glob.glob('foo_*.txt'):
    for item in rem_list:
        print(item)

511,Is there something built in pycharm that builds requirements.txt for pip? Also how do I call pip install requirements from within my code? I am looking to package my code in a double click executable or at least run from terminal and it automatically installs all the modules and everything..; Does windows have pip too? I never used microsoft windows so I don't know how my code would run there..
511,windows installations of python includes `pip` these days by default; You can use Inno Setup to create an exe installer for windows <http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php>
511,Thank you <@Carri>; What about pycharm and `pip` Requirements.txt?
511,<https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-requirement-files.html>
512,or use the command line `pip freeze &gt; /path/to/requirements.txt`
512,"Ideally `requirements.txt` should be populated manually, using top-level requirements such as `django`, `requests` and `djangorestframework`. After you have all of that in place, do `pip install -r requirements.txt` once. Then do `pip freeze &gt; requirements.lock.txt`; Then always use `requirements.lock.txt` to install dependencies"
512,"I do a `<http://requirements.in|requirements.in>` where I just list the requirements without versions, then `pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt <http://requirements.in|requirements.in>`; and that maintains the exact versions."
512,"Or that, yes, using `pip-compile` flow"
512,"i then use a service called PyUp I think it is to submit PRs when my stuff needs to be updated.; It’s a pretty nice workflow, but yup, just one of a couple possibilities"
512,"But `requirements.txt` contains not only exact versions of dependencies, but exact versions of dependencies' dependencies"
512,oh right good point
512,"That's the point of having two different requirements files; In that case, the file with exact versions is often called a ""lock"" file"
512,"a nice thing about the `pip-compile` (not sure if others offer this as well) is it adds comments about where the dependencies come from; yeah I guess that’s a good point, it might be better to use that naming scheme"
512,"&gt; it might be better to use that naming scheme
Unless there's a tool that requires a specific naming, like `pbr` which expects `requirements.txt` file in the root of the repository; (I personally don't like it, I'd rather have a way to explicitly specify the path to requirements in the `setup.cfg`, but I've managed to overcome this by symlinking `requirements/runtime.txt` to `requirements.txt`)"

520,I think if the image is scaled using some actual scaling procedure then this wouldn't be valid but if you're just looking where the point would be proportionally on a different size image then you could use: `x1 / initial width = x2 / larger width` and `y1 / initial height = y2 / larger height`

523,"Hi, since numpy is for mathematical calculation how can I create this array, from pos 640,478 as x,y and the top left of a square grid 30*30 pixels (900 pixels); anyone know how can I get output of time in h:m:s from seconds; hours: minute: seconds; the input is seconds remaining"

524,"I have a microservice providing timeseries data to a REST API. I want to always have the API return a maximum of 1000 values for each request, that means I will somehow have to resample the values. Can someone advice me how to do that?"
525,"okay in two words, about problem..
I have the schema file <https://github.com/MichaelYusko/Geijutsu/blob/master/geijutsu/schema.py> and the basic idea, it’s validate a dict object.

For example

```
# Test class
from geijutsu import schema

class User(schema.BaseSchema):
    name = schema.Str(max_length=10)
    age = <http://schema.Int|schema.Int>(required=True)


user = User({'name': 'Mike', 'age': 10})
```
If everything is ok, need to return original object `{'name': 'Mike', 'age': 10}`

If data something like that `{'name': 'Mike', 'age': 'AGE'}`
need to return `{'age': 'Field must be integer'}`

I have some basic structure of project, but I need some advices, how I can improve code/structure and etc..
Thanks guys!; :slightly_smiling_face:"

529,If this is about python my bad
529,I will be looking at it and if things turn out might be willing to help
529,"it's a simple issue though, the rendered image has pixels offset seen on the image"
530,"not sure, what are you looking for?"
529,"<@Meg> you'll see there's a grayscale image above the one in full color, it shouldn't have the lines and I believe it's because of the way I create and edit positions in javascript then render it in PIL that's bringing black boxes lines"

what’s the best way to avoid using a line continuation there?; i can only think to use nested `with` statements which seems similarly ugly"
529,I would use nested `with`
531,"if those are the only two choices i would definitely go with the next `with`, anyway :slightly_smiling_face:"
529,maybe as ugly but more readable imo
529,i figured i must be missing some better option
529,you can look at `contexlib.Exitstack`; but if you only have two it might not be worth it; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack>
531,Why not set patch as decorator to test function?
531,I would use `contextlib.ExitStack`
529,that does look promising although it looks like i’ll have to depend on the python2 backport
529,"<https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack>; Oh, that's 3.3"
529,<@Beula> :face_with_rolling_eyes:
529,"Oh, wow; yep - my slack client didn't refresh yet; <@Ciera> :taco:"
529,mmm that might work.  i’m not that accustomed to using the patch decorators so i didn’t think of it :slightly_smiling_face:
529,haha yeah it happens sometimes :pacman:
529,"I use it for 2 levels or more, primarily because flat is generally better than nested"
529,"One disadvantage of this usage, is that mocked method will be patched for all test function, but this leads to make them smaller ==&gt; smaller unit test"
529,I agree but for only two levels it might make things a bit too complex
529,yeah that seems like an advantage :slightly_smiling_face:
529,I like when you have multiple nested context managers with `if` for the one you want to enter
532,"Hi folks, It might a bit unrelated here. But i’m trying to use an api from other service. They give apikey, password, shared secret. apikey and password alone can help me get access to the api. So why we need an shared secret. I’m working with shopify api. Thanks!"
532,<@Hermina> - Usually when they give something like a shared secret it's either so your application can validate incoming requests (aka webhooks) or you can sign a payload before sending it to them (so they can validate similarly)

536,<@Ok> show us your script
536,And how you're calling it. Be sure to add logging to your script to know when/where it hangs (sounds like it's in a queue and never gets to an executor)
536,U mean python script <@Collette> 
536,Yep
536,I will try it <@Beula> but am able to execute other python scripts in jenkins
536,<@Beula> more like the python script is waiting for some input
536,Or that
536,Sorry <@Collette>  its too big script.. ; But its a unit testing kind off
536,"<@Ok> click on the plus sign to the left from the slack input field, and choose ""Add code or text snippet"""
536,<@Collette> its actually from my office server so i can take that script out
536,What?
536,Is cant take that script out to here
536,"In that case, you need to add logging to find where in the script the execution gets to - but beyond that I am not sure we can do much"
536,I will try as u said <@Beula> by logging to script
536,"It's a pretty common way to debug, it should often be one of your first actions when you hit an issue"
536,first question is. does the scrip try to run ?
536,Yeah since am just new to this world of python and Jenkins thing learning <@Beula> 
536,Then add logging/print statements pretty judiciously :slightly_smiling_face:
536,"Script is trying to run, it not throwing any error but just running <@Ciera> "
536,"As <@Collette> mentioned, are you waiting for an `input` (or `raw_input` in py2) in the code? Any `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`? etc"
536,Or contains an infinite loop
536,No there is no input needed.. as i said its running fine in command prompt without error; Only when i integrate in Jenkins causing this error
536,<@Ok> do you have *any* output?
536,Yeah the out should be an html file
537,"Speaking of logging. Is there a good best practice article on how to configure it? I'm getting double messages, but have been too busy dealing with functionality to try to figure out where I went wrong."
537,<@Meghan> You probably just have `propagate` set to true: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.propagate> That will have anything handled by a nested logger bubble up to the ancestors

538,Hi Everyone Really need your <#C07EFMZ1N|help> I have deadline coming up for my project demo So can anyone provide with some knowledge on how to go on to build these interactive message buttons for a bot response in slack?; I am using Python for my development
538,"<@Juli> You usually get the best responses here when you have *specific* questions, where are you actually stuck?"
538,Yes so what I have till now is a bot in slack that uses Slackclient/RTM API/Flask for fetching a message in real time from a channel and only if it has certain keywords in the message then the bot responds with a ok message for now!; But what I want to do know is instead of replying with an ok message reply with these interactive message that does some particular action based on the button the user selects; But I am firstly not able to find a good documentation or a step by step guide for going with building this in python; So if anyone can provide me with a good tutorial or documenation or can point me to the right resource for building these in python then it would be a great help! Thanks !
538,Are you new to Python and http?
538,"Not new to python can write code with python and dealing with data, pandas, os, sys, functions, lists, etc! But not great with web and python so yes struggling with http and web related stuff!"
538,"I am just trying to gauge what kind of resources to send over, have you started with <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments> ?; calling <@Ciera> - is your sansio lib ready for prime time?"
538,no not yet :confused:
538,Yes <@Beula> I was reading through these yesterday but due to time constraints I was looking for something more narrower that gives an example of how to build one of these with python; There are examples of how to build one with node
538,doesn’t sirbot currently do this?
538,Yeah; But that's asyncio based - I wasn't sure if it would be a confusing resource
538,But I have not worked with node and was not finding a good documentation with python
538,<@Juli> go take a look at the sirbot source code.. it might be async but the process between your app and slack should be similar.
538,Let me find a direct link
538,yea that will probably be easier.
538,"hmm, well there is the giphy code... but not the router for the events; <@Ciera> - can you point a good link for responding to message buttons from the sirbot repos?"
538,Thanks will have a look! That would be very helpful
538,yea i haven’t had time to continue the bot tutorial but i’ve noted slack buttons :wink:.
538,<https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-slack/blob/master/sirbot/slack/dispatcher/action.py#L34>; this is the coroutine that handle incoming `action`; like press on a button; it is then routed based on the `callback_id`; for giphy it is routed to this:<https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-pythondev/blob/master/pythondev/slack.py#L341>
538,<@Ciera> :taco:
538,<@Johana> that would be an awesome tutorial! Also I don't think there are many available already. Hopefully even I can contribute to it in a while
538,you can then respond with a new message or update the original
538,Thanks <@Ciera> Will look into these; Thanks <@Beula> and <@Johana> as well! Really appreciate that!
539,"I'm late to this, but this library makes working with Slack easy: <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot> <@Juli>"
538,yea i used that originally for the bot_tutorial but i had to hack it too much to get it to run in a jupyter notebook.
540,it expects a settings.py file in the root of the dir which is a little outdated nowadays.; if anything the config should look for it and offer another method or use env vars.
540,"For the bot I wrote with it I did have to go around one of the recommended methods with the decorator and grab the data dictionary. But, otherwise worked fine.; Environment variables are an option.; I agree with the settings.py though, that part should be fixed."
540,<https://github.com/lins05/slackbot/blob/develop/slackbot/settings.py#L39>
540,oh i guess it does have it.. opened my mouth again.; lol; still kinda not a fan of what was done there.
540,"I wrote a bot with it that may be fun, after a discussion in here on Friday. A bot that executes python code from the chat if the tag is included. Of course, it will need a lot of safety checks before it runs the code."
540,"<@Meghan>, <@Beula> mentioned having some code that does that. it will setup a docker container and execute. perhaps something like that would work for you. i’m thinking the benefits are you can remove networking, volumes, etc."
540,"yeah, I should pull that code out of the other project"
541,"Anyone worked with BBD and python ? 
looking for recommendations"

540,had to quick scroll away from that link
540,ah sorry
540,Lol

540,"but there is other definition than the nsfw one that are pretty funny :smile:; more seriously, I haven't"
540,saw a bunch of libs but most dont look like they have much of a community
540,"BDD doesn't seem to be huge in python, the only place I have seen it really big is node and ruby"
540,"bummer. Have been doing it in JS, feels different but idk if better yet.; I weirdly feel like I want to write the tests"
540,I guess that's a good outcome!
540,"LoL, I’ll take it !"
540,It could be done kind of cool with context-managers probably
542,Does anybody know where I can find documentation for `pkg_resources`? It doesn't seem to turn up anywhere except the setuptools documentation
542,<@Wilda> `pkg_resources` is a part of `setuptools`
543,"Anyone know why from:
```
    x_spacing = [0,
                 int(x_axis_max*1.25*.2),
                 int(x_axis_max*1.25*.4),
                 int(x_axis_max*1.25*.6),
                 int(x_axis_max*1.25*.8),
                 ]
```
And to display:
`ax.set_xticks(x_spacing)`
`ax.xaxis.grid(color='#d0d0d0')`

It would display a line for all x_spacing values except the last one?"

546,"Hey guys. Newbie here! (just posted in the introduction channel!)
I'm building my first web app where the user logs in using his twitch account. I implemented python social auth for django (<https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django> ) and it works fine.

Now I want to add custom attributes to the SocialAuthUser model. I want to get the values for these attributes from the user's social account (twitch), so I'm gonna do a get request to twitch API using the access token I got on login/registration.
My question is, how do I extend the SocialAuthUser model and add the get request to twitch in the pipeline? 
more specifically:
1. How do I add custom fields to the SocialAuthUser model
2. In what .py file and in what class, method or function do I do the get request to get the data to populate the custom fields? 

Hope the question makes sense. :slightly_smiling_face:

547,"For a string `s`, is there something equivalent to the POSIX tool tr's `tr -s ""  "" "" ""`?
That is, replace all occurances with double-space with a single space; until there's no double-spaces left; ```
SPACE = "" ""
while 2*SPACE in s:
    s = s.replace(2*SPACE, SPACE)
```
is OK for my use cases I guess, though re-creating strings all the times is slow"
547,you shouldn't need a while loop
547,`s = ' '.join(part for part in s.split(' ') if part)` should work; <@Lanita> ^^

547,"Thanks <@Vada> , I will look into it. Haven't really liked the idea of listening to podcasts appealing but I did subscribe to Software Engineering Daily, last week."
547,Yeah that works - although I tend to avoid regex; I tend to listen to them on commutes or when I'm at the gym; or washingup/cooking; times when I'm doing something manual and can't actively use my brain

Thank you"
550,"For what? As usual, details about use cases are required for suggestions "
550,"on how it work together, Imean the concept or architecture. because I don’t have yet experience in Python, and my team whole department is planning to move to python; for instance is that possible to use apache spark with django with python. and if that possible to rid the cron and just use rest api using python; I am quite straggle on how I can align my team for this. and we have facing problem with PHP which is not valuable for big data analytics"
550,I'm not sure the tech from the client to the database matters here - normally with spark wouldn't you stream off a read-replica and process the data?
550,"<@Beula> I am not sure yet, because I don’t have experience yet using spark, I just quite in research and deep dive study by next week. but using spark with django is that make sense?"
550,"That's what I am saying, i don't think the ""with X"" is relevant"
550,"so meaning it cannot be mixed? is that what you are saying. but how can I use spark as web app interface? sorry not sure If I am correct on what I am saying but this is what I am thinking. correct me if I am wrong. thanks <@Beula>; because in Ruby, I can use Rails, then add the gem of apache spark to use; but since we need a language that can process a big data analytics so we will choose python, which almost the same of ruby"
550,"I don't know spark well, but as far as I know you connect spark to a database and run the data transformations off there. What loads that database doesn't matter (PHP, Python, Raw SQL, etc)"
550,I think you are correct. thanks <@Beula>

552,"Hello, can I get some help with tensorflow? I'm doing image recognition, and I've seen in different examples that I have to use `tf.gfile.FastGFile(image_path, 'rb').read()` as my image data. But I was wondering if there's a way to use an image in memory instead; I want to use an image in a post request (I'm using Bottle framework)"
552,"check whether that tensorflow method takes in a file like object; if so, you can create a temp file, read the image into memory and pass it in"
552,It takes the path of an image. Should I write the file to the disk and then pass that path to the FastGFile class?
552,I find it weird it can’t take in a temp file
552,"I'm not sure of what FastGFile does. Perhaps it just reads a file as I would normally do with python, and adds extra features. I'll try to read it as normal, and pass that as the image data, skipping the FastGFile object"
553,"hi guys, in which case we should consider using multi processes rather than threads? I think if we have 4 core, we can create 4 processes with might better than 4 threads using one process right? I’m writing script to migrate data from db postgres to other db (elasticsearch)"
553,is what you have currently going super slow?
553,"i’m running threads, and few like its quite slow, trying to update it to make it faster"
553,"In python we have the gil, which only lets a single thread run at a time. Given that, the only way threads help you in python is io bound things (waiting on network requests). Processes help for cpu bound work, but sharing data is expensive as it makes entire copies to share (since memory space isn't shared in python)."
553,i’ve never filled elastic search with tons of data but i have done so with postgres. typically in these situations you gotta be careful about your database sessions and want to use a connection pool.
553,"Agreed, I'm not sure how much perf you can really squeze out of a database migration (but since it should be 1 time, that's probably ok "
553,"yea… i agree there sometimes its ok to ensure all the data goes in properly.; i know i’ve done well over 10,000 transactions a second with postgresql. i’m not sure about elastic search."
553,"umm, I do it quite simple by using django orm model. So technically I just assign my_models[0,100] to thread1, my_models[101,200]  to thread2…..
So each thread, I think it have it self connection pool. (every time I run 5 threads, I see 5 connection to db is open).
Sorry I still not clear what you are suggesting :disappointed:; if I spawn 4 processes, will it use 4 core in cpu? Or I’m lacking of OS knowledge…"
553,yea you might be ok. try it and see what happens.; when i need to do a bunch of database work i just use a work queue.

555,"If we want to build a dictionary like this:
```

Is there a function `f` that would allow for this?


I very often find myself repeating this pattern:


```
d = { ""some_preknown_key"": ""some_preknown_value"", }
if cond1:
    d[cond1_key] = cond1_value
    
if cond2:
    d[cond2_key] = cond2_value

```
d = cond_build_dict({

    when(cond1, cond1_key, cond1_value),
    when(cond2, cond2_key, cond2_value),
})
```

which would return a regular dict, with the `cond1_key` and `cond2_key` keys only
present if the first argument of their respective `when` function call is `True`.; when could return the equivalent of `cond1_key : cond1_value`  if the first argument is True, else puts some key: value token of some kind that will be filtered out by cond_build_dict (which is a function that takes a dict and remove all keys containing this token)"
555,"&gt; Is there a function `f` that would allow for this?
Kinda.; ```

...     if random.randint(0, 1) == 1:

{'hello': 'world'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'hello': 'world', **conditional_data()}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'hello': 'world', 'condition_is_met': '1234'}

555,"<@Suellen> yup, that's how I've been doing before; but I'd like to have everything be in one place, to make it visually easier to parse; since it looks and feels more declerative; one built-in option that works if you're okay with keeping the key is simply doing

```"
555,"well.. it's easy to cross into ""ugly code"" territory"
555,"yeah; what I just wrote wasn't ugly though, but it can quickly get ugly"
555,Personally I like the explicit `if` statements. If the dict really does have a variety of different permutations I like that to be explicit in the code
555,"short, declarative code in one place is typically easier to read than slowly mutating an object to get to where we want to be"
555,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'hello': 'world'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; condition = True
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update({'abc': 'def'} if condition else {})
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'abc': 'def', 'hello': 'world'}
```
More real-life example:
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'hello': 'world'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update(**user_data() if store_user else {})
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update(**group_data() if store_group else {})
```
This way the key isn't added to the dictionary if the condition is false; but I feel like it's already a bit ugly"
555,you could do a loop on your condition/value
555,the upside is - you can cycle through multiple additional_dictionaries and conditions; <@Ciera> :slightly_smiling_face:
555,"I like declarative code, but sometimes it obscures the outcome."
555,"```
for condi, key, value in ((True, 'a', 'b'), (False, 'c', 'd')):

555,oowie oof ouch
555,"it's hacky imo, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

555,"What message? :wink:; One addition could be to add support for recursive when's, so that you can build an entire tree from it; hm, but that would require another cond_build_dict and that'd be ugly; some way of supporting this:

```

555,"those two aren't equivalent; (hm, need to get to lunch... gone for an hour)"
555,I don't really agree with that but each is own; if you name the function with an adequate name it should be obvious what it is doing and hide how it's doing it
555,<@Lanita> how so? What's the difference?

555,"<@Lanita> `get_query_kwargs3` is still just one line shorter than `get_query_kwargs1`, what's the point?"
555,it's not all about the number of lines; it's about general readability (both of the entire thing and in diffs) and the ease of changing something
555,"I am not convinced. I think `get_query_kwargs1` is simple enough to write and to maintain, and `get_query_kwargs3` isn't much better to deserve a tested and battle-proven implementation of `cond_build_dict` and `only_if` functions."

in 2nd case you will still create item in dict no matter what bool value of collection_name. And secondly `only_if` does pretty much look like `stm1 if cond else stm2`, don’t you think so?"
555,"<@Liberty> 
&gt; in 2nd case you will still create item in dict no matter what bool value of collection_name
No, the idea was `only_if` to return a sentinel object if the condition is false, so the corresponding key won't be created within `cond_build_dict`"

555,<@Liberty> привет земляк :blush:
555,"I'm trying it out with actual code, and I've figured that...
1. it's shorter, but not that much shorter. It does reduce duplication though

555,"but only if there are lot of conditions  and they are made somewhere else programmatically, then it would make some pretty cool “magic”. But if you only got few of them and they hardcoded there then you should use 1 option, as it’s easier to understand and read."

557,"Hi guys,
I am a newbie in Python. I know what I should do but the syntax is killing me.
I am working on a subscription task. We got 3 different memberships in our company. I have got the upgraded members already. I need to differentiate renewed and new members from each other now. In our db, there is a subscription table in which I can find a membership id and one or many subscription id for each member. Also, a start and end date for each subscription. So, what I need to write is: 

 For this member 
    if There is more than one start date and the other start date is before the first date of the chosen timeline 
    Then RENEWED
    Else NEW

If someone knows how to do it and help me in syntax, it will save my DAY!

559,hi everyone so I was going through this tutorial and <https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok> but did'nt quite get the Step 2: Refactor our script to work with Slack has ayone worked for something similar in python?
559,"<@Juli> are you stick on the slack oauth2 part, or what?"
559,yes <@Beula> I am stucked with the oauth and event subscription part; So my main goal is to create these interactive buttons right! So for that I have to create this slack app and in the request Url i use ngrok followed by a /slackmessage . Now I will have to do two things right. 1. Create an endpoint to handle post request to this request url and then respond to slack and 2. Within that Slack oauth and event subscripition also comes into play right?; Correct me if I am wrong anywhere. This is what I understood; and help in python for the same?
559,"&gt; Within that Slack oauth and event subscripition also comes into play right

not necessarily. If you have only one team you can do that in the slack app interface"
559,"Then how is client id, client secret and verification token etc come into play here?; It works without authentication?"
559,you can find them in your app page; after you install it on your dev team
559,Because in this blog also the author said it did'nt work for her without authentication so i thought its necessary <https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/slack-app-or-bot-user-integration-842c3843eea8>; Yaa I got that but then do I not have to write a code to handle those parameters/tokens in the request/response to that Url?; Or is it done by itself?
559,for action I don't think you need to perform any authentification on your side; you can check with the verification token if the request is coming from slack but it's not mandatory
559,I think this is the part where I am stucked/not able to understand properly. Any python/flask example to handle request response to these request URL without Oauth?; I went to <@Alesia> but still not able to understand it from there
559,where is the best book about design patterns and algorithms (in python?)
559,you need to put an url in the interactive message setting and have a flask app listening on this url; and you should be good
559,"<@Chantell>  To be honest, I don't find design patterns are as important in Python as they are in Java or C++. A lot of the big problems that the traditional design patterns solve don't really exist to the same degree with Python"
559,I don't really have a python example on hand :confused:
559,"<@Chantell> The Python Cookbook used to be a good collection of algorithms and snippets, but I've not read the Python 3 edition"
560,agree with <@Gabriele>
559,and it has some design pattern implentations there
559,okay.. I own an older edition of the python cookbook..  I was looking at it last night.. Maybe I just need to buy the new one.; o gosh.. the older edition i have from 2013  is the newest one.  Okay
559,"oh…just remembered there is <https://github.com/faif/python-patterns>

559,yeah.. this is mostly to advance my perspective.. not for a specific work project.

564,help with code; `code`; i get this error
564,<@Margaretta> the `set` object in python doesn't support indexing because they're unordered collections of items
565,as soon as you convert a list to a set you lose the ordering of any items inside; you can optionally cast back to a list and then sort again; `topdata = sorted(list(data))[0:3]`
566,tl;dr I want to create multiple record of a Model based on a variable which sits pn the webpage(fron-end)
565,<@Marcie> :taco:; <@Marcie>  - This works; `data=sorted(set([sanitize(t) for t in data]))`

567,<@Latrina> what's stopping you from just creating three instances?
567,"its not only 3 , it depends , For example : If anyone wants to add 6 items, then they will add the items on the frontend variable(var item= 6) ,now  its 6 items; so the no of forms to be generated  depends on the value of a variable in Javascript; <@Marcie>  do i have to use a for loop for this or is there any other way ?"
567,a for loop is fine if you need X instances of something to be created
567,so in this case i have to pass the Js variable value(let's say n) to my function which will set the forloop to n.; i was researching on this and found formsets(extras=some value); can i use form sets in my use case?; Anyone ??

568,"<@Jeanette> looks like either `parent_url_path` or `slug` are `None`, can you post more of your code that's causing this error?; oh ok, sorry, I didn't realise the exception was coming from library code; either the `wagtail_modeltranslation` package is broken, or it's expecting your model or some other part of your code to behave differently to how it actually is; oh good heavens, they're dynamically attaching methods to classes"
568,yes and based on the language that is chosen you get the translated field
568,"just makes it a lot harder to figure out what's going on without actually attaching a debugger to your code, that's all; maybe file an issue with `wagtail_modeltranslation`? search around first to see if someone else already has, though"
568,yep that is true; It's been a couple of hours now ...; Why is it trying to reach the en version? I don't get it; tried: ['en/((?:[\\w\\-]+/)*)$']
568,"I think at this point, you need to attach a debugger and put a breakpoint on that line in wagtail_modeltranslation/patch_wagtailadmin.py; Because that's a wagtail issue, and if it's not reported, then the debugger can help"

569,"I have a package that I'm developing. I want to use the package inside of a virtualenv and install it with something like pip... but that's not possible unless I create a setup.py, right? Since pip only works with setup.py?
Setup:
```
mypackage/
    mymodule/
        __init__.py
testcode.py
requirements.txt
```
I can import the function defined in __init__.py to testcode.py by creating a virtualenv then symlinking the `mypackage` folder to my virtualenv"
569,you can create setup.py and call it directly
569,exactly. There is some tools that ease that. I heard some good things about Flit but never used it myself; <http://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
569,I was just thinking that it's be nice to not have to manually symlink or write the setup.py (until it's needed later for packaging purposes)
569,you can also install your package with the `-e` flags for pip; that allow you to edit the code in place without needing to reinstall each time
569,"yeah, but I still need a setup.py for that?"
569,`pip install -e .`; yes
569,"Hm, I guess I'll just manually symlink to my venv's lib/python3.5/site-packages folder until I've written a setup.py file; Since it's symlinked I can edit the code in place just fine"
569,you might want to take a look at the tool I linked :point_up: it does almost everything for you for the setup.py
569,"looking at it, it seems like a way to generate the setup.py and upload it to pypi. But I'm not sure how it helps if I'm not uploading it to pypi"
569,well generate the setup.py :smile:
569,"I suppose, but through another, new sytnax; syntax; by the way, I haven't heard much about alternatives to pypi... is there a way to create a custom repository like pypi, or do people usually just install from git repos? (Which pip support); I suppose there's little reason to create a custom pypi repo when serving things from a git repo is simple enough"
569,usually from git or pypi; there is also <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi> if you want your own pypi; and <https://pypi.org/> that is in the process of replacing PyPi
569,"what's the difference between ""the"" pypi and <http://pypi.org|pypi.org>?; who thought that calling them the same thing was a good idea?; I see, it's a rewrite called warehouse but the main implementation instance will also be called PyPi."
569,"<http://pypi.python.org|pypi.python.org> is the legacy server, <http://pypi.org|pypi.org> is the new one; Naming it the same makes sense since it is the same thing, basically everything beyond the frontend and some plumbing, but the same spec"

572,google to aws? Nooooo
571,AWS is fine :slightly_smiling_face:
571,yea. i just like googles setup more. and also can be a lot cheaper.; but im going to be setting up a project on aws too with ELB and docker using spot instances.; mostly because we use it at work so i just want to make sure to have more chances to be familiar with it
571,at what point do you actually need to use AWS or google rather than rolling your own?
571,"spot/preemptive instances can save a lot anyways.; to me, none"
571,I'd say when you need more of the components together than are available on their own
571,i guess if you have highly specialized reasons
571,AWS you pay for ingress/egress (data in/out) - so if you are moving data around a lot AWS makes good sense
571,like dropbox benefits from their hard drive tech they work with
571,(~AWS~ -&gt; _Preferred Cloud Provider_)
571,"Azure is good, but its more expensive.; and not as feature complete as google/aws"
571,"btw, are there any providers that provide ( :slightly_smiling_face: ) access to bare drives?"
571,yea
571,"I want to roll out ZFS, but none of providers known to me allow it"
571,you can do that in AWS cant you?
571,so is it more a case of ease of use or something?
571,look for dedicated boxes.; yea
571,thought so
571,why the need for zfs?
571,"""very specialized reasons"" :slightly_smiling_face:; and their dedicated boxes don't use SAN or anything like that?; just drives that I can access?"
571,on aws you can make pretty custom images.
571,do they give you much control over it though?
571,oh. idk about that much; not sure honestly.; <@Orpha> likes that one provider. cant think of their name.; linode
571,"i used to just use linode or other vps providers, recently started using digitalocean, they have a nice api for interacting with stuff"
571,i like DO too. slightly more expensive than linode but UI is far better and they have a nice api
571,just wondered if i was missing something obvious with the aws stuff
571,you should be able to make custom images; check the first result here.; <https://www.google.com/search?q=aws+custom+image+with+zfs&amp;oq=aws+custom+image+with+zfs&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.11042j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8>
571,using puppet and similar tools sorta makes a lot of it moot for me
571,makes what moot? the system setup?; i havent used puppet. i tinkered with ansible. but i mostly just use docker
571,"not the system setup, i mostly use it for management"
571,using alpine base images and host as either ubuntu or coreos depending on the needs; ah; managing infrastructure?
571,very small infrastructure
571,i learned about terraform for that and want to try and start using that
571,"Last company we just prebaked a base AMI and used that, no need for complex tooling"
571,i think we use cloudformation at work. which is similar and built into aws; yea. makes a lot of sense for most cases; at work they want to use docker but dont know it very well. so hopefully going into a devops position i can play with that some
571,im currently playing with docker :joy:
571,"We used docker on those, that was just the base system setup/config and docker was deployed onto it"
571,it seems pretty neat
571,Should we take the convo to <#C22DMH61M|devops> ?
571,Si
571,<@Bruno> linode is currently updating their ui because they're tired of you complaining 
571,"sweet; lol. their UI is pretty bad. though, not as bad as godaddy"
573,still better than using c-panel
571,yea. i would also prefer cpanel over godaddy
573,haha
574,"Hi all, I am having an issue with sorting nested OrderedDicts..

I  am trying to sort both the outermost dictionary, and the following dictionary by a key value in the innermost dictionary.

Given the attached snippet, this what I am trying to accomplish:

- For all foods, order the food subtypes by highest calorie content (i.e - For Pizza, Pesto should appear first because it has higher calories when compared to cheese.
- Order all foods by highest calorie content (i.e - Pizza should appear first as it has a subtype with more calories than any other food); Before I tacked on the outermost dictionary, I was using this to sort just the food types (red,green,pesto,cheese):   `OrderedDict(sorted(d.iteritems(), key=lambda x: x[1].iteritems()))` .  However, I am not sure how to proceed after having tacked on the outermost dictionary."
575,"The problem is then how to cast this as an OrderedDict?; If that is the issue, then I can think of many non-pythonic approaches."
574,"Right, I'd like to make the structure into an OrderedDict. Can you point me in the right direction?"
575,"why don't you try sorting the 2 groups separately, casting them into OrderedDict type as above. I ran your code and you are sorting operation is just making it alphabetical, ignoring the inner loops; sort Pizza, sort Apple, find Max of the two, append in order.; if you do the following `for item in d.iteritems(): print(type(item))` you will get `&lt;type 'tuple'&gt;`. You then have to unpack it accordingly making note of where your value pops out.; now, if there is a less convoluted way to do this, I am all for it.; the downside to this is that your sorting has to be via if/then type args inside each top level tuple. If there are more than two food subgroups, then you might call sort in the inner loop"
575,I appreciate your help. I will see if I can play with the problem a bit more given your suggestions..
575,"I also wonder at what level your reply ought to be; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10756427/loop-through-all-nested-dictionary-values>; this can get  recursive, as you might see.; this is why mentioned something about pythonicity earlier."

581,"Hello. I need help with tensorflow. I have a bottle server that sends an image to a tensorflow script which categorizes the image; After I send images around 5 or 10 times, it starts slowing down. The performance decreases a lot. The first time, the script runs in 1 second, and by the fifth or tenth time, it takes almost more than one minute.; This is the code that I use to categorize the images using tensorflow; And that is the code that I use to run the server; This is the line that slows down after many images: `predictions = sess.run(softmax_tensor, {'DecodeJpeg/contents:0': image_data})`; How can I improve performance?"
581,"what are your server specs (ram, cpu)? How often are images sent to tensorflow?"
581,"4GB Ram, 2 cores 1.8GHz. Right now, I'm sending the images myself through postman so it is not something specific, but I tried sending one image, wait until I get a result, I give it 5 extra seconds, and then send another image; The first 5 times it gives a result in one or two seconds, then it starts slowing down"
581,"I wonder if there’s a memory leak; and more resources are being used, specifically ram; also, with your tf script, move the import outside the `recognize` function; because its a wasted import each time"
581,Is there a python module to profile that?
581,its a code smell; only import modules in a function if you really need it locally and it costs alot to import
581,I mean a module to profile the allocated memory
581,<https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/profile.html>
581,I'll run it and hope to find the problem
581,do you know if tf.session is actually releasing your mem?
581,"that’s a good question; beautifulsoup has a bug, that with a context manager like that, it still doesn’t release memory if used in a loop 1000-1500 items long"
581,"I assumed it does, since it's the recommended way according to tensorflow documentation. I'll try closing it manually"
581,i would check github and see if this is an issue
582,"ok, so are you using a dev server for this or guicorn/wsgi?"
581,"eg, bottle/flask dev server"
582,I'm using bottle
582,"yes; but the dev server, eg command line start utility, or nginx/apache with gunicorn/wsgi?; becuase if this is on your local machine with zero prduction configuration, its either your machine or a memory leak"
582,"Dev server I think, I'm running it from command line"
582,alright; what happens when you wait one minute in between; and run `top` to see what your system’s free memory looks like during that time
583,"When I waited on minute after receiving a result, it was almost the same, it was eventually taking more time to get a result. Free memory sometimes decreased a lot when I sent data, and sometimes it decreased just a little, but eventually I had less free memory; I tried not using anymore the context manager, and instead I used `sess = tf.Session()` and `sess.close()` to close it, but I had the same results"
583,what size are the images?
583,18kb
583,have you tried this not using bottle?
583,"No, do you think bottle could be the problem?"
583,"no, it shouldn’t; but would be interesting if you can run this code standalone with an image; take the web server out of the equation and test with just tensorflow; would give clues to which direction you should go into"
583,I don’t really know. I’m trying to isolate issue.
584,"I tried two things, first I called the function to categorize in a loop, and got same result, by the 5th time it was slowing down. Then I tried to call in a loop my code to categorize as if from the command line, using `os.system(""python label_image.py image.jpg"")` and it worked, it always took around 2 seconds. So, does that mean that it is a memory problem? Or perhaps something when I import tensorflow"
584,does travis-ci support any kind of test that requires a database?
584,you can request some services to be present; I suppose mysql/postgres should be one of them
584,also is it recommended to test for returns from a sqlalchemy query&gt;?
584,I would; <@Prudence> have you pulled the tensorflow import outside of the function?

584,one does what one can :smile:

588,Thanks. tried that but I think i used the wrong 'character'; yep. Have to find it on my keyboard. Sec :9

591,On the `__init__` you are handling the exception by just printing it. That will cause that when there is a connection problem your script will just print the error and continue. I think that's not what you want; Don't catch exceptions for just printing; unless you are doing something with value with it. Dont do it. Let your program crash
590,nice catch and thanks
591,for example in your case: you could catch the exception to try to retry the request; although i think `requests` can do that for you
591,"thats a great idea tbh; and yeah thats exactly the behaviour i would like, thank you <@Mariano>"
591,check this: <https://www.peterbe.com/plog/best-practice-with-retries-with-requests>
591,<@Mariano> :taco:
591,"You are doing the same con `create_dir`. How things are right now. If the user doesn't have the permission. It will print the error and continue. Which will cause that `save_dump` will try to create a file on a dir that can't be created. Unless you have a workaround the permission problem, let it crash on `create_dir`; That's all.

600,"Has anyone used Hug? How do you make a route accept a binary file? The documentation doesn't say anything... the first argument is always an empty dict, even though it should contain the file; Hm, finally got it to work by manually setting `@hug.default_input_format(""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"")`"
600,"<@Lanita> a lot of the times you’ll have to look at the falcon docs; i love hug, but find it extremely hard to use sometimes due to the lack of documentation"

601,"I have the following with me 

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_date = datetime.datetime.strptime('2017-07-03T20:35:45.000Z', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_date
datetime.datetime(2017, 7, 3, 20, 35, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime.now()
datetime.datetime(2017, 8, 21, 22, 4, 20, 215391)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

I wanted to find out whether `some_date` is N days older than today or not? Like lets' take N as 2. Then I wanted to find whether some_date came two days ago or not. How should I subtract both?

Would this work? <https://stackoverflow.com/a/441152/3834059>"
601,"yes, timedelta is made for exactly this sort of purpose"
601,Let me try it out.; <@Gabriele> What I am trying to find out is whether the day difference between the two is more/less than N days. A bit confused over how should I proceed :sweat_smile:
601,Create a timedelta of N days. Compare that to the timedelta you get from the difference between the days.
601,"&gt; Create a timedelta of N days.
how should I do it?; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.timedelta(days=90)
datetime.timedelta(90)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
```; ^ this would not the way I assume"
601,"yes, that is the way"
601,"<@Gabriele> 
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; timedelta_today = datetime.datetime.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=90)
&gt;&gt;&gt; timedelta_today == datetime.timedelta(days=90)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;
```"
601,"date object - timedelta object =&gt; new date. or date - date =&gt; timedelta, and check the n on that (if you go the second route, timedelta_object.days will give you the day diff"
601,"<@Carri> 
I think I figured it 

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_date = datetime.datetime.strptime('2017-07-03T20:35:45.000Z', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_date
datetime.datetime(2017, 7, 3, 20, 35, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime.today() - some_date
datetime.timedelta(49, 7033, 562942)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (datetime.datetime.today() - some_date).days
49

602,"<@Meg> Got it working. :smile:
Was the exact same graph (with data) as when I had last ran it. Turned out that although I was editing a new file, it was still running the previous file. Error alerted me after I erased the earlier file. Also, did not make it a class. Maybe it should be, but I'll wait until a future version."
602,"ah, makes sense.; glad it was a simple issue!"
603,"what ways would you guys automate adding new users at a company, to remote servers? the most open way i can think of is just a simple bash script for setting up a users local environment, to also add their user/key to a remote server."
604,ansible ?
604,yea. we use salt stack at work so i was looking into that too.
604,"I like making them set it up following a guide, myself. Then they actually know what's up"
604,i already have a bash script made to do the process. part of the process of me moving to ops at work. i think for normal stuff though a bash script is probably going to be my best bet.
604,Then have them enter their stuff in a web-form or whatever for the remote server
604,yea. they want to make it all automated.; i just ask questions with bash `read` on the cli
604,They are shooting themselves in the foot if the people who know how things really work leave - but aight
604,"well to be fair, most of the devs dont need to ssh into remote servers. we do use vagrant for local dev. we do have a guide for getting into those and debugging; we can already deploy testing setups based on the current app that are short lived anyways (default 24hrs). mostly just for testing; and we dont allow people into normal staging/prod"
604,what about LDAP?
604,we dont have an ldap server
604,that’s what i mean. set one up.
604,would be another way too though.
604,that’s probably more long term.; i’ve had to use a number of approaches at different jobs. the most simple i can think of atm is ansible but saltstack can do the same.
604,ive never set one up? are they hard?
604,i’ve only setup windows AD before.
604,ah
604,i should set one up. they can be useful for businesses and all sorts of applications.
604,im not sure we would need that though. since devs are limited to what they can ssh into remotely anwyas
604,if you are already using saltstack just use that.
604,yea. that was my thought. i was just trying to think if there was any other methods i should consider or make an example for.
604,"yea, onboarding is always one of those “stop and see how to do this better” things."
604,im wondering if i should even make an example for that. since i dont think its something we will be using anyways.; our onboarding setup is already pretty good. vagrant and opendns to provide accecss to staging servers.
605,Whenever I run `pytest say_hello.py` it says `no tests ran in 0.00 seconds`
605,<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#test-discovery>; Pytest can't find your test function 
605,So the file has to start with `test_` and be in a directory?
605,Your assert is just run on first import of the file; So yes
605,it still can't find it :disappointed:
605,<@Alba> please show your directory structure and how you run the command ; Maybe this quick post will help with the command <https://pyslackers.com/blog/testing-a-python-library-with-pytest/>

  -test_say_hello.py

inside Practice i'm running `pytest`, outside Practice I run `pytest Practice`"
605,"Did you look at the post? You shouldn't have the test files in the same dir, and be sure to `import Practice`, then run `python -m pytest` from the parent dir "
605,"Thanks you, I ended up separating the files.
Practice / 
  -__init__.py
  -say_hello.py
  -test_hello.py

then inside `test_hello.py` i did `from say_hello import say_hello`"

607,Oh. Thank you. Would join there.
608,"Hi, everyone. I am very new in python world. 
What's the difference between `python -m pip install pymongo` and `pip install pymongo` ?"
608,I think they are the same thing. `pip` just calls `python -m pip`; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25749621/whats-the-difference-between-pip-install-and-python-m-pip-install>
608,"That's not strictly true, but ~often~ in most cases they're interchangeable; You should use `python&lt;version&gt; -m pip` when in doubt which python will be used to invoke `pip` executable"
608,"Depending on how you installed Python and Pip, you'll usually have a `pipX.Y` binary in your `$PATH` too"
608,and use a virtualenv for your project to not cluter the system python
608,"thanks a lot guys, I am reading it. And yes, I am using virtualenv in my project. :stuck_out_tongue:"

610,"Hi guys I am new around here, have a question what do you recommend continue with Python from beginner to intermediate level, or experience my next programming language on my list (Java or Javascript)?"
610,depends what your end goal is.
610,"becoming a developer, still dont know what area or direction?"
610,I'd advise looking into that aspect. Because it will help you decide
610,I want to go for data science or ML vs web applications
610,"so, ML and data science is heavily python now; some java in those fields; but, languages are just tools"
610,"Haha, language is such a tool!"
610,"pick which one has the best applications to your task at hand, and balance with community participation and library support"
610,If you like data science and ML then maybe stick with Python and look at playing with `scikit-learn` for a bit
610,"I already started 2 data science courses, but is so hard to focus on them, cause there are so many other sources for this, duno still try to focus on something and finish it, I think is a kind of trap these days with so many free access to knowledge still I happy for this though"
610,yeah
610,"yeah, pick one, finish it, then do another one"
610,"one of the difficulties is figuring what to focus on; and sometimes its like reading a topic at wikipedia; you're on one particular article, with a link to something esle"
610,"believe me I am all over the place right now, accessing a lot of info"
610,and then somehow you find yourself reading about a coast guard rescue in the 50s :=D; wikipedia rabbit hole

611,What about YouTube? It's like quicksand
611,it's rought and get everywhere ?
610,"I don't go there much, since I don't get much out of those videos without good captions"
610,guys anyone of you did some kind or pair programming or found a mentor that helped you?
610,"not really; there were a couple seniors that I leaned on when i was a junior; but code reviews and quality feedback are essential, I feel; as long as the critiques are fair and balanced, and you don't take them personally"
610,still trying to decide to go for a conversion program from business (my major) to ICT vs bootcamp vs continuing self study; of course I want to get into programming to get a job and enjoy
610,"I was self-taught for several years, then went to university. I think the idea of an individual mentor is a bit of a luxury, but getting feedback via forums, Slack, Stack Overflow etc, is a good alternative"
610,"also, groups like this are invaluable; as long as you find a good one, and learn how to properly ask a question"
610,":slightly_smiling_face: I discovered slack and ICT groups 2 days ago, pretty new around here"
610,Sorry? You mean YouTube videos without captions? (Not sure if you were talking to me) <@Meg>
610,"<@Thomasina>, not you specifically; more like relating my experience with youtube as quicksand :smile:"
610,"Oh, I see. However might I ask what you mean by ""captions""? Just curious."
610,"closed captioning, subtitles; I'm deaf and wear hearing aids; so, while I can hear just about everything in my hearing range (have pretty significant high frequency loss), there's a large gulf between _hearing_ and _understanding_; so, I use lip reading alot to understand speech"
610,"Oh, wow! I had no idea! Well, that makes perfect sense then.; Are the YouTube auto-captions still :poop: ?"
610,"so, for me... if we were talking face to face in English, I wouldn't have any trouble conversing with you.  but if you were to rotate so your back was to me, you'd go from speaking English to Russian.. and I don't speak Russian; lip reading helps me to put values to a series of sounds of speech to understand; and autocaptions have come a long way, and the ones for conference presentations are very good"
610,yes
610,"but there's a big difference in that quality and what you see in movies, TV and live programs; and that's mainly due to quality of the audio, as well as placement of the microphone; with speech, the closer the microphone, the better."
610,"Oh, yes. Actually I have a lot of interest in developing accessibility-related products (primarily for their function and not so much for profit). It's good to hear that - at least for some videos - auto-captioning has gone from laughable to actually helpful. There are so many ways that technology can be used to aid those with various circumstances and conditions, and even those I _think_ it has improved somewhat, I feel like the entire field could use a lot more attention and work."
610,"there actually is alot of work going on now; in fact, microsoft research has shown that their auto transcription error rate is lower than that of professional transcriptionists; <https://qz.com/812317/microsoft-msft-claims-its-speech-transcription-ai-is-now-better-than-human-professionals/>; but again, the primary differentator is quality of the audio combined with background noise"
610,"Niiice! Well, glad to hear there are some significant advances being made then. While (as far as I know) my hearing is alright, even I would appreciate automatic, perfect transcriptions. Actually I often use subtitles with educational material even if the speaking in the video is good, as I find it helps me to fully comprehend what's being said."
610,i like subtitles for the comprehension too. i feel like i understand better.
610,"same here.. I acutually did a project in undergrad using dragon naturally speaking in transcribing college lectures; turned out, it worked best for online video classes, specifically my calc 2 class"
610,also when you have a baby and don’t want that baby to wake up you get used to it.; lol
610,"ha yeah; I can imagine, wou;dn't know from personal experience :smile:"
610,"that’s when i noticed w/ subtitles i picked up more on the conversation or little giveaways.; dragon is really nice.; my wife was an aspiring writer for a couple years and she used that.; again, b/c of baby. lol"
612,"Hey, I'm trying to scrape ""<http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=pit&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2017&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2016&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0>"" and put it in a MySQL database using beautiful soup.   Not only am I having trouble finding the correct table in the html, i can't figure out how to identify it in my soup code.  The documentation has been less than helpful.; I've never used a web scraper before, and I'm pretty lost"
612,<@Bernita>  What does your current code look like?
612,"yeah, you're going to have some issues with that; take a look at the networks tab in your browser tools; for example; <http://www.fangraphs.com/extfghtml.aspx?fgtype=30>; all that information is populated dynamically; so, what you'd need is a headless browser; load the web page in the headless browser, wait for it to finish"
612,I'm trying to set it up so that I can run it every morning and refill my db then run my rankings algorithm
612,"then extract the html from the browser, toss it in BS and extract what you need"
612,sorry...headless browser?
612,"run the browser without a gui; so you load the web page as it would normally; so, waht happens with that site you want to scrape is that the data is all loaded asynchronously; so, requests and beautifulsoup won't do; you need to have a browser instance running to load the content, render it as you'd expect"
612,ouch...can u send me a link that describes what im trying to do?
612,"well, you can google it yourself and find a number of resources.; but the gist of it is like googlebot crawling websites for indexing; <https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome>"
612,ok cool...thanks; back to the drawing board lol
612,"or check if that site has an api you can use; FYI, there's <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping> channel here"
612,you're a g...appreciate it
612,"iinteresting, the TOS on that site doesn't say anything about not using the data; just this 

&gt;ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.; usually with sites like those, there are stricter usage conditions"
612,"I was once in a similar situation, I used Selenium to open a webpage, dumbed its content into a file and parsed what I needed. If you use webdriver you don't even need to use a headless browser."
612,"actually, you do; because selenium needs something to actually render the page; typically, chromedriver, phantomdriver, etc"
612,"You're right about that, when I said you don't need a headless browser, I meant you can just use your regular browser"
612,"ah, ok :slightly_smiling_face:; yup, true; but that's also more time-consuming, and not quite what I think <@Bernita> wants in this case"
612,"I never used the headless chrome, but it looks like it's already capable of creating a simple dump without any other tools! That's actually pretty cool"
612,"yep.  Originally, you had to go through quite a few steps to do it, and so phantom was usually the option of choice; but now that google's made headless chrome much easier to use in testing, usage rates are going up; which makes sense; <http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/>; take alook at the server/runtime part; PJS is PhantomJS, and its pretty incompatible with ES6"
612,"Since when does it exist? I remember looking for a headless browser last year, but couldn't find anything useful except for phantomjs"
612,"but given that there was only one dev/maintainer, even getting to the feature level it did is a great accomplishment; <https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome>; its available on linux and osx as of chrome 59, windows as of chrome 60"
612,"Pretty cool, have to remember that"
613,Yes. And I'm not sure why they haven't improved it yet.
614,is there a way to package my current version of python3 and also all the packages i downloaded in my virtualenv into 1 file so then I SCP my whole project to another machine?
614,you can do a recursive scp and move the folder with all the contents
614,"<@Sharika> assuming the same architecture and system deps, you could probably just tarball up the project dir... but that's a bit odd - may be best to use Docker, install them fresh, or maybe pyinstaller"
614,o wait n/m you want the virtualenv too.
615,"Hey; are there any jinja template language masters; I have passed a key into the template {{course.id}} I need some way of accessing that key in dict {{course_completion_percentages}}.

618,"I am having some problems on a server where my script doesn't seem to be releasing or reusing memory. Obviously that makes me run out of memory and hit my pagefile. It doesn't matter what script I use. I see the same results. 

It is windows server 2008R2, NETSVCS seems to be what is holding onto the memory.  ; Any one have any ideas on where I can look for resources, or what I can do to find the memory leak. "
618,what's the script?; I've had similar things happen when using beautiful soup in a loop
618,there is some profiler available. Some should have memory support
618,even explicit garbage collection call ever 100 iterations didn't work
618,`memory_profiler`
618,"In one, I am creating a batch script  that has a bcp statement and then executing that script.  It is a large archiving process so I am going it in loop to grab date information to plug into the bcp command. I can share the script when. I get to my office. ; But again, it doesn't seem to matter the script. My sys admin is convinced it is the code, and to some degree it is, but the memory is still held even when I kill the python script; I'll look at memory_profiler when I get to the office too"
618,"held by what? If the script process is dead, it wouldn't show up in any diagnostic, so how do you know it's being held?"
618,"I can see, in resource manager, that the memory grabbed while the script was running never releases back for use. Ii know what you are saying cause that was my thought. That is why I am hoping to trace the trail to see if I can figure why a service holds to the memory after grabbed in the script"
618,"so you're saying that even after you kill the process, the memory is never released?"
618,"Correct, but I can see it being consumed as a script runs (almost all of my scripts have something to do with lots of data). "
618,are you accessing a database or something ? you sure every connection are cleanly closed ?
619,"I’m a little confused. Are you running it in .bat script, right?"
618,"I am accessing a database, I make explicit closes to the connection, before the script ends, on any script where I am using psycopg2 or pyodbc. And on a BCP command  I'm executing a batch script which is a self contained process; @malasjkovv I do a little of both depending on the needs of the original"
618,"as far as I remember if you kill bat script which runs python process inside of it it will no kill Python process itself, but I may mistake"
618,"sometimes it's possible to do something which triggers a memory leak elsewhere. For example, I once saw a computer with network drivers that had a memory leak. So if I downloaded a big file, 10 minutes later the computer was unusable"

631,"Any recommendations on how to write understandable documentation for
e.g. dicts of dicts?

Let's say we have a function that returns a dict like this:

```
    {
        ""XUC-231"": {
            ""Volvo"": ""A nice Volvo"",
        }
        ""ABD-417"": {
            ""Ford"": ""It doesn't work!"",
        }
    }
```

Using Python's typing module (which we could put as a function
annotation), we could write this as:

```
    def f(...) -&gt; Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]:
```
    
or to make things clearer:

```
    RegistrationNumber = CarBrand = Description = str
    def f(...) -&gt; Dict[RegistrationNumber, Dict[CarBrand, Description]]:
```

Or perhaps something more... GraphQL-y perhaps? Something like

```
{
    reg_number: str {
        car_brand: str = description: str
    }
}
```

This would also give us a recommended variable name for each variable,
which is worthwhile if we want other functions calling this functions
to interact with the dict using the same name."

`RegistrationNumber = CarBrand = Description = str`; I feed violated"
631,<@Suellen> I didn't choose to let str work as both a type annotation and a function :slightly_smiling_face:
631,Is a docstring on your function not enough?
631,"yes; but I'm wondering what's the best way to write it; that's most readable; Right now I'm using the first function annotation (with aliases), and the docstring also contains an example of actual data; *without aliases I mean; e.g. no RegistrationNumber... stuff"
631,I doubt that a good docstring is not enough; you can try showing your function (or only definition) to somebody and let them guess what it does
631,"Yes, but then how would you write the docstring?; as in, actual ""syntax""; Describing it in words is super verbose and hard to understand; especially with dicts, I've never found a good syntax I like for describing what the key and value represents that isn't overly verbose"
631,that's one of the hardest things in computer science :slightly_smiling_face:
631,When I'm sketching out stuff on my own I usually use some type of Hindley–Milner with an Haskell-like syntax for describing these things; but then I convert it to python's typing module annotations (e.g. valid python code/syntax)

633,Is there anyone who is familier with HappyBase for Hbase Connectivity
634,"Design question for you guys.  Not sure what is considered the correct way to do this in python

I have 2 types of output files (s3 and fs).  I have created a class for each.

I have a script which actually creates the data and then writes it to the output files (obviously the s3 and fs classes are abstracing out the differences between the two).

I have been debating if it is better to pass the class of the output file in, or pass a generator function in which can create the output format.  At first was leaning towards the class, but the more I think about it, the more I am leaning towards a generator function.  

Multiple output files are created by the script which is why I can't just pass an actual instance of the object."
634,"That sounds like a case for a function; `write_to_s3` and `write_to_fs`, specifically"
634,"well the function wouldn't actually do the writing, just generate the ""file"" to write to; I basically just wrapped up the s3 to act like a file object so I could write and read to it like a normal file"
634,ah
634,this way the script doesn't care where it is writing
634,Then you just need to accept a file-like object to write into.
634,right kinda.  since the script is generating multiple files I can't just pass in the object
634,You'll need an object per file
634,"I was initially thinking to just pass in the class, but started to lean more towards passing in a funciton that returns the object"
634,Just like you need a regular file object per file
634,"correct; would it be better to pass in an open_s3_file function or just pass in the s3_file class that responds to open (just like a normal file); both will work, just wondering what is considered more pythonic"
634,It would be better to pass a `S3File` instance that acts like a file-like object.
634,"I can't pass the instance since I don't have it yet.   The script will need to create a bunch of them; the script/function is basically reading a bunch of tables from a database, doing some transformations and then writing them out to files; the destination could be an s3 or standard filesystem; the way it is currently written it only writes to the standard filesystem, I am trying to abstract out the destination so that it can write to s3 as well"
634,"Yeah, pluginbase module seems to do what I want"
635,"so, lets say you have a section of code with multiple try-catch blocks.  Which do you prefer: breaking them out to handle specific exceptions, or just have a catch-all for everything?"
635,Anyone here familiar with Odoo?
634,this particular case has to do with looking in solr(pysolr) and S3(boto)  So I need to handle possible throws of `pysolr.SolrError` as well as `botocore.exceptions.ClientError`
635,"right now, I'm doing the former"

636,"Hello everyone - I'm looking for direction on a work project. I'll put a sample of the information I can get below.  I work in a factory making car parts. There are two plants, about 10 departments in each plant. About 650 machines total. I would like to have something set up that I can see machine downtime by week/month/year, by department/plant/machine. I would like to see the count of breakdown occurrences, and various other information. (I'd love to explain if someone has time to talk to me about it). Anyway, i can export our reports to csv and get the information from there..But not sure what to do with it. Should I be looking into classes, or a database, etc."
636,Are they handled the same or different? 
636,"Report number | Date | Machine Number | Downtime | Description; There are 10,000 reports for this year alone. I made a massive spreadsheet to break all of this down, but it's soooooo slow; Not sure what direction to go with this"
636,"If you're familiar with databases, or have someone who is familiar with them, then why not - put stuff there. You basically get aggregations for free, and aggregations are a foundation for all reports.; On the other hand, `pandas` can load CSV data and make reports on the fly as well. No need for a database if it's not a whole lot of data ( &lt;10 GB)"
636,"differently, primarily by setting different variable values"
636,"It'll all be text, so small... I don't have any familiarity with databases, so I'll check pandas out"

636,"Yeah, if anything is different I'd have the two separate handlers"
636,"<@Blanche>, if the project is very time-sensitive, I agree with <@Suellen> ‘s suggestion, but if you’re going to be doing this sort of thing regularly, it might be good to start learning databases by building out small jobs to extract and store your data."

637,mysql is to <@Suellen> as mongo is to <@Patty>
637,Postgres for lyfe
637,it's funny that postgres is more efficient with non-relational data than mongodb...; a cruel joke almost
637,"The answer to most questions which contain the word ""data"" in them is ""postgres"""
638,"how much less efficient is it to query records where a field is in a json type, compared to say a standard varchar field (assuming both are indexed)"
637,Not that I can answer the Q
638,but it will depend on JSON vs JSONB right?
637,not that much I think
637,probably. i havent researched much of the difference between json/jsonb in postgres yet.
637,"`jsonb data is stored in a decomposed binary format that makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead, but significantly faster to process, since no reparsing is needed. jsonb also supports indexing, which can be a significant advantage.`; from the docs"
638,yea. but what if theres 10k records. or 100k
637,with indexing it could make a huge difference
638,ah sounds like i would prefer jsonb then.
637,100k is not very big in the db world <@Bruno>; xD

637,oh i know. but if im already filtering by user...; but i suppose there could be 1m after a lot of time. its for personal budgeting. so the the largest table would be all the bank transactions that come in.

637,"yea.; granted, it will be a while before i get there and can come up with a plan later on. but yea.; so, this is what the transaction data coming in would look like <https://plaid.com/docs/api/#transactions>"

637,yea.

641,author_name?
640,"root project name, but yeah; `ProjectName` is a module so to speak"
640,__init__.py has to be in a folder in order for the python interpreter to be able to see into that dir and load files from it as modules
640,that makes sense. thx
640,"fwiw, I was also able to leave tests where they were (under ProjectName/) by adding .. to my env's search path"
640,that's... not great
640,oh yea? I was afraid you'd say that cause I like it better :-X
640,"changing system path isn't really a nice solution, only temporarily"
640,"if I understand it correctly, I only changed it in my virtualenv that the unit tests run in not system level, still not the greatest?"
640,what if you distribute this package to users?
640,I have to cd into the tacticsiege/ directory in my notebooks before I import but that's fine

640,where?
640,"it depends on where you make the request. in postman it will show the response. if in the terminal, it will spit out the response when done (httpie is great for this). in a python script, there should be some response object you can get the results from. how you access that will depend on what library you are using to make the request. In order for people know better answer, it helps to have a sample of what you are doing. <@Hyman>"
640,"<@Hyman> on the response object. It will be as `.json()` if the response is a Json one, otherwise I think `.data()` both are covered in the docs ; <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#response-content>"
644,":waving_white_flag: I'm confused about something

This app is creating an object which calls another class' _init_ and then later modifies the variables within based on a config file. When a function from that particular class is called, it uses the init values, not the ones assigned outside the class. 

Clearly this is some kind of scoping issue but understand it well enough to explain it to my colleague. :confused:"
644,<@Dell> can you show us the code?
644,"technically no but I kind of boiled it down to the essence here; so where this json is loading and setting it, that works - but when _run_ is called those assignments don't exist; it just goes back to None"

644,"<@Suellen> yeah, i already know -- i'm asking how to build c-based packages faster; (even not on alpine linux)"
647,<@Ramona> I don't thing there is. But I'm not a big user of them. I usually just put flake8 with a little bit of options and that's all
644,"i can bear with that i need to build things from ground up, but i want to make the build processes fast"
644,wheel are not available ?
644,not on alpine; make a docker image; accept the slow build time; deploy to docker hub
647,<@Ramona> quite possible.  once I have that kinda stuff going on a project it tends to stay that way
644,how about unit testing any idea?
644,so it’s been a while since I’ve looked into this stuff.
644,and use that image
644,hmm. could you built your own wheel and upload on your own devpi or something ?
644,hmm
644,but not sure that easier to do
644,i'm already using multi-staged builds to make it fast
644,<@Assunta> standard library unittest module or pytest
644,"then, another way of question: how to determine all the file list that is created by the build process of a wheel?"
644,"yeah I think pytest is the common thing these days.  there again I’m out of date, using nose still"
644,yeah pytest is the common one
644,thanks <@Ciera>; I will look on it. since I am not aware in python. I used in Ruby Rspec and TDD. using codeship; but will look fully on it; thanks guys for the details.
644,"i'm already doing like this:
```
FROM python:3.6-alpine as python-source
RUN cd /; tar czpf python.tar.gz /usr/local/

FROM myimage:latest
COPY --from=python-source /python.tar.gz /
RUN cd /; tar xzpf python.tar.gz
```"
644,pytest might have somehting for TDD (but not sure I don't use it)
644,"maybe if i can do the same for cython/scipy/pandas/..., it will be great"
644,"<@Ciera> ok, but is there anyway to have a continuous development that includes unit testing? I found this book: <http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/praise.harry.html> using django; but I am not sure If I am on the right track"
644,that depend on your CI
644,yeah that’s more of a process question than a tools question
644,you might also want to look into `tox`; `Gives boto a facelift` Nice one :smile:
644,heh
644,"so, would it be sufficient to zip &amp; copy the package directory (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy`), with some tweaks on pkg-info files"

It seems that CFLAGS can be passed easily for Cython build; But I couldn't find anything standard"
644,CFLAGS are for individual c compiler invocations
644,"yes, of course; I wonder if it's possible to pass MAKEOPTS this way"
644,setuptools seems not to use makefile at all
644,"there's a `--global-option` and `--install-option` for pip, but these options are passed to `setup.py` and it must deal with those -- again not standard"
644,"tried, but only some packages have their own specific options via that interface; there seems to be no general way; :disappointed:"
644,yeah :disappointed:
644,hm; i think i should go for separate image builds (either using multi-staged or different images) to build wheels for alpine linux
644,"haha, you can override `make` to point to an alias `make -j4`; but that's crazy; but, I mean... if it works.."
644,"<@Leigh> <https://github.com/mzdaniel/alpinewheels>; its a little out of date, but perhaps you can use the context within to make progress?"
644,oh... thanks for the reference!
644,<@Leigh> turns out `cython` doesn't use `make` at all

650,"same, just with solr; but ES/Solr are pretty similar in use cases"
652,basically i want for example to query ES data index via Python/Jupyter. Is elasticsearch-py worth trying?

661,<@Vita> what's your commandline; i.e. how do you launch gunicorn
661,sec
661,and you totally have `myapp/app.py` with `def create_app()` inside?
661,"yep! It was working last time I tried, but I finally fixed other errors and now it won't work (this has been going on for about a month)"
661,"btw, I suggest a different approach, because strangely this method doesn't work for me; what I did was:
1. created `wsgi.py` in project root; ```
from projectname.app import create_app

app = create_app() # pass something in, I dunno

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

661,not docker related; if your server works and you can connect to it -- docker already did its part
661,<@Suellen> ok thanks
661,did you find the culprit?
662,"Nope, still looking for the issue causer"
661,other pages are accessible?
662,"Nope, but I think I may have found the culprit...i am not importing my views into wsgi, gonna see if that fixes it; alright that wasnt the issue (i am using blueprints)"
661,"`create_app()` should take care of all that; your app should also work the same when using Flask debug server, or gunicorn, or any combination; otherwise something isn't right"

663,Does it matter whether I `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;` before or after creating the rest of the tables in my database?

Why does this keep giving me a syntax error?; Looks perfectly fine to me; Oh wait, is `::geography` an SQL and not a Python thing?"
663,it is :slightly_smiling_face:; probably even postgres specific
663,"Ah, ok, my bad; `cast(geom, Geography)` is supposedly the way to do it but it doesn't work because `name 'cast' is not defined` but I don't know why and there are literally no relevant results when I search. :confused:; I must be missing something but I don't know what"
663,`func.cast(...)`; I'm not 100% certain
663,You need to work with sql and not python for that 
663,doesn't GeoAlchemy provide helpers?
663,"I'm on mobile so don't have the links handy, but postgis has exactly the same queries you're looking for; If it's anything like geodjango, it implements some but not the entire feature set"
663,"<@Suellen> Of course! I was just uhhh...testing your knowledge! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:; <@Suellen> :taco:; <@Meg> `cast(geom, Geography)` seems to be the way to do it with Geoalchemy"
663,"Sweet!; There's certainly a learning curve to figure what's been implemented in the orm and what hasn't.; For example, geodjango doesn't have any clustering built into it, but you can do it with postgis once you install the nearest neighbor extension "
663,Definitely. I figured out how to do what I wanted to do using SQL in the command line but didn't realize it'd be a bit different in Python.
663,It will be; Because geoalchemy has its own interface to use; So you'll have to translate from a working sql call to how geoalchemy does it

674,"I do almost all of my programming for cli, but for this program I think a gui is appropriate for my user base. It would be a rather complex cli interface if I were to try it there.; ```    def apply_selection(self, rv, index, is_selected):
        """""" Respond to the selection of items in the view. """"""
        self.selected = is_selected
        if is_selected:
            print(""selection changed to {0}"".format(rv.data[index]))
        else:
            print(""selection removed for {0}"".format(rv.data[index]))```

This is the example they give, and I could use that to build a dictionary of what is selected. Given that what is selected is on the screen at all times though, I would expect that would be an option from the start. I don't see anything relevant in dir(object) though."
674,it seems to be triggered by an event
674,Right.
674,so I guess everytime you select or unselect something this function got triggered; or maybe you need to bind it somehow to a specific check box
674,"Exactly.
```selection removed for {'text': 'DSL'}
selection changed to {'text': 'EVC-Maps Statuses'}```"
674,oh ok I just re-read your initial question. my bad.; well I don't know :smile:
674,I'm thinking I'll add a callback to it that updates a dictionary in the rv object then just retrieve from there. Would think that would be something they would have included though.
674,myabe there is something to get all checkbox and then you can just find the one you want in those ? selected or not
674,"It's actually a listbox type of interface.; But, I think I'll just add a callback into the RV object and maintain a dictionary there.; As you can see from the screenshot, user interface design is not my specialty."
674,:smile: it's better than mine
674,"One nice thing though, that box in the bottom right formats using restructured text. So, pretty formatting that should be easy."
674,ooh nice; be carefull some here would prefer markdown :smile: :troll:
674,:rage5:
674,"lol, I am more comfortable with markdown, but I saw the rst box, don't know if they have a md text formatter. I can learn rst for this though."
674,"RST is pretty nice, it's a lot more flexible than MD as far as output formats - that's a big reason it is a thing (afaik)"
675,Hey guys I want to contribute to open source. Can anyone point me right direction to start
675,"<#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects>, we have 2 projects that are open source with lots of issues of all sorts of difficulty."
675,"How much python do you know? A lot of projects always want help with:

1. Documentation
2. Testing
3. Features

We have a few, as <@Johana> mentioned, otherwise there is always any library you like/use that can probably use help"
676,Is anybody here familiar with lowess/loess surface fitting?
676,"In this example, should the function always be like `_()`?
Can it return a named function instead? If so, how would I do that?

```
def raise_to_input(exponent):
    # '_' is the function that's being returned, which is then assigned to a name.
    def _(base):
        return base ** exponent
    return _
```

```
print(raise_to_input(3))
# &lt;function raise_to_input.&lt;locals&gt;._ at 0x10a77a730&gt;
input_base_new_function = raise_to_input(3)
print(type(input_base_new_function))
# &lt;class 'function'&gt;
print(input_base_new_function(10))
# 1000 = 10 ** 3
print(input_base_new_function(2))
# 8 = 2 ** 3
```"
676,<@Bonita> - did you try it? You can name the function (but really it gets re-assigned when you do `foo = raise_to_input(x)`); What are you really wanting to accomplish?
676,"<@Beula> I did attempt it, but received an error. If the work (assignment) gets done in that step, than it’s necessary to leave it in. I was just looking for a way to remove that step. I don’t have a direct application for it at the moment. I’m just learning the concept. Thanks for the help.; <@Beula> Like, maybe, adding the name of the returned (newly minted) function as an input parameter, for instance."
676,"oh, you want a dynamic ""name"" `func.__name__`?; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foobar():
...   pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; foobar.__name__
'foobar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foobar.__name__ = 'baz'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foobar
&lt;function foobar at 0x102d29f28&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; foobar.__name__
'baz'
```"
676,"<@Beula> I think so, but am unclear on the terminology. I’m experimenting with it to try to figure-out how that works."
676,"To answer the original question, you can return any function object:

```
def foo():
    def baz(v):
        print('value:', v)
    return baz
```

If that is what you are going for"
676,"<@Beula> ```def foo():
    def baz(v):
        z = v + 7
        print('value:', z)
    return baz

print(foo())
# &lt;function foo.&lt;locals&gt;.baz at 0x1084b9840&gt;
print(baz(3))``` It raises a NameError over `baz`. While, ```baz = foo()
print(baz(5))``` provides `value: 12`. Am I understanding correctly that it’s not possible to remove the assignment step `baz = foo()`?"
676,Correct due to scoping rules; baz is defined in a nested scope that's not visible to you after it's returned 
676,<@Beula> Great. Thanks. That makes it clear.
677,"Hi guys is there anyone around that can help me out?; I'm working on a technical test I was given.  I completed the test, and my code works.
I've been asked however to make it installable via pip.
I'm abit confused as to the process.
I created a setup.py, I've uploaded it to pypi (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boggle2/0.1>)
and you can install it using pip
```pip install boggle2```; but as ive never done this before, I'm not sure what is the end goal here?  Is it that once you ```pip install boggle2``` you won't need to download the code from my github repo?"
677,exactly; then you can `import boggle2` in your python repl or script
677,ok and once you run import boggle2 you can run my code?
677,"and quick tips you should .gitignore the `__pycache__` dir :slightly_smiling_face:; yeah then you should be able to do
```
import boggle2

boggle2.board_generate()
```
for example"
677,"ok, so I created a virtualenv to test it out.
I did the 
```pip install boggle2```

677,hmm. I think you are missing something
677,Ok; Does the file structure when I uploaded to pypi matter?
677,you need something like `    packages=find_packages()` in your setup.py
677,ok
677,and `from setuptools import find_packages` at the top; otherwise it doesn't know what packages it bundle
677,"ok so
```packages=['boggle2', 'test_boggle'],```; something like that?; and the import statement at the top"
677,`find_packages()` should be enough; it should autofind your package
677,"ok, so ill upload again, and then when I create a virtualenv and pip install, I should be able to import boggle2"
677,but you might need to have your script in a directory; `boogle2/boogle2.py`; not sure if it's mandatory or not; maybe someone else knows

680,is it Python 2 or 3 ? as your Line#71 is Py2.x style while the rest are Py3.x style
680,"Python 3; yeah i guess i forgot () around print statement, changed it now; still nothing"
680,the code looks correct to me
680,I'd use a debugger and step through to find where it gets stuck (pdb or whatever is built into your editor/ide); That's better than any of us guessing what is going on
681,"or if you don't have a remote debugger connection set up, use print statements or log to a file on the raspi"

Image gallery, with functionality: everyone can see images, admin can see add remove edit. Images/posts contain info, title, image etc

So very simple; what I know I need pretty much is Flask, authentication, somewhere to upload them (?) and fetch them and show them.

So, what I was thinking is using s3, flask with some authentication, any better ideas on the workflow?; Haven't really deployed any python apps so I am a bit confused. Although, I once did deploy one to my on VPS, but it was quite a mess to hassle round with UWSGI + other"
682,if it's simple flask is a good way to go :slightly_smiling_face:; (and if it's more complex it's also a good way)
682,"yeah, heh. I always overcomplicate simple stuff"
682,<@Shirl> can you confirm that keypress events are being received in your code?; <@Sean> that's pretty easy to do!; thats where communities like this are handy
682,<@Sean> one thing to look at - you can pass signed urls to the client and have them upload the images directly to s3 so they don’t have to go through your server
682,"<@Junita> something like this is exactly what I was hoping for - even ignoring the whole server part all in all, but is this possible?"
682,"well, you need some way to have auth, right?"
682,you would still need a flask + postgres behind
682,for the admin to upload - yes.; <@Ciera> exactly; where do I keep that then? also in AWS?
682,"well, you *can* do auth using lambda and their cognito service"
682,"one downside with direct to s3 upload is you're relying on the client for the upload, and bypassing restrictions can be done"
682,might be easier to start thought just doing a simple flask app
682,"if you do it server side, that's trickier to work around, and you'll be able to store metrics and other info about the uploads/images"
682,<@Meg> when you create the signed url you can restrict it to that specific file upload
682,<@Junita> I like your proposition when he just said `I always overcomplicate simple stuff` :smile: :smile:
682,:stuck_out_tongue:
682,"<@Meg> uhm not really, i’m trying to use debugger but not sure how to do that either"
682,"in a sense it actually simplifies it, but the big issue is it’s easier to get help with a simple flask app than running the world via lambda  :stuck_out_tongue:"
682,"<@Shirl>, are you using something like pycharm to write your code?"
682,no i’m actually writing it in atom and testing it on Rpi through ssh
682,"ok, that makes things a little trickier; you should look at how to set up a remote python debugger with atom"
682,"ill be back in little over an hour, let's see what i've came up with :slightly_smiling_face: see you soon :palm_tree:"
682,"<https://atom.io/packages/python-debugger>; unfortunately, that one doesn't support remote debugging"
682,"but if it’ll make a lot easier for me to debug with pycharm, i can try to get that instead"
682,"and doesn't seem like other packages will allow you to do so; there's a community version that's free, and should fit your needs here; but its a more full-featured environment than atom, with a learning curve.; not to dissuade you, but as a heads up"
682,isn't the remote debugger only in the paid version ?
682,"not sure, lemme check"
682,I think sshing to the rpi and using logging/print could do the trick; or use the rpi ide
682,"+1, or run with `pdb` via ssh"
682,"yeah, rpi is headless right now"

PyCharm says do not assign a lambda expression, use a def.; For its PEP 8 checks."
688,"Since it's just a no-op, I would just `# noqa` it and move along"
688,"```
Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier.

Yes:

def f(x): return 2*x
No:

f = lambda x: 2*x
The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is specifically 'f' instead of the generic '&lt;lambda&gt;'. This is more useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda expression can offer over an explicit def statement (i.e. that it can be embedded inside a larger expression)```"

692,"I'm not sure I'm understanding what you are saying, can you show that part of your code?; Why would you not provide the string as an argument?; Also, regex could be the wrong way for this. Regex really should be used when other string manipulation can't do what you want easily."

695,"so, relevant code is probably there"
695,"true, i think it has got do with the fact that the `someLib.process(req)` is being called by multiple workers"
695,"what is that library?; hm.. even if it's not thread-safe, does that mean it's not multiprocess-safe?; I'm honestly not sure"
695,it is a library which I created myself to wrap C++ code. Didnt take it account thread safety
695,"in theory it should be ok, since a whole process is launched for the task; a debugger of some kind is your best bet, guessing will only take you so far; One guess left:
&gt; req = someLib.Request(); This is a shared resource that's used between processes; that's not very good; can you refactor it so that each worker gets its own copy?"
695,sure will do; it still waits; essentially it prints all the 'before' statements and hangs
695,inside `delegate` too?; up until you call a C function?
695,"delegate does not call the C function , it is `someLib.process(req)` which does; i even decoupled that line into 2 lines : ```c_resp = someLib.process(req)"

703,"we're giving a simple doc about available variables to them; in practice, there is no ""user.is_admin"" for them; i mean, the real input is, ""is_admin"", and i change it with ""self.request.user.is_admin"" like thing"
703,If you truly do have an arbitrary list of completely unrelated conditions then I fear that there is very little that can be done to improve your situation
703,fair enough; thanks btw
703,If you can simplify the conditions in some way - e.g. to make them all into conjunctions (everything must be true) - then you can make it more data-driven
703,"hm, in this case we're sorting `seq` first so we're not getting the first value of `seq` as much as ""exactly one value from seq"", but it doesn't matter for me at the moment"
703,I'm really not sure how to change it right now
704,"Hello everyone, i have a question about class initialization

so i have a class that i am importing into a main .py file. Lets call it imp_mod.

i have the init defined so that when i call imp_mod.ClassName() it runs the init. but it also seems to be running the rest of the methods inside of the class. Why would it be doing that?"
704,"so you have something like 

```
class ImpMod:
    def __init__(self):
        # some code here
```; and you’re calling it via `imp_mode.ImpMod()`?"
704,yes
704,what do you have defined in the `__init__`?
704,underneath that i have a function that runs the self.desktop_driver called def search(self) and it runs a loop. When i call imp_mod.ImpBot() it seems like it is running that search function that isnt being called in init
704,"You don't seem _sure_ though. Have you tried putting a print statement in that search function to confirm, one way or the other?"
704,"i just did as a sanity check, and my print statement inside search does appear; might it be because in the main function i am assigning it to a variable?"
704,would you mind adding the entire `ImpBot class`?
704,You'll have to show the code
704,bot = imp_mod.ImpBot(); sure
704,"does it also happen when you do

```
from imp_mod import ImpBot
bot = ImpBot()
```"
704,ill see; yes it still does it
704,what is `search_terms`; and where are you declaring it
704,search terms is an array of strings that lives outside of the class but in the same file
704,Most likely it's the stuff outside the class that is causing this problem
704,ok
704,perhaps something is making an instance and calling .search()?
704,"so...i have a tkinter button; ill put that file in; h/o; the command arg is set to call the search; so that may be it, but idk why it is running it before the Tkinter menu even appears"
704,perhaps it's set up wrong. sometimes people put in the `()` in the UI code when they shouldn't
704,ohhhh; so im doing .search()
704,exactly
704,"when it should just be .search; ohhhhhh; WORKS; thank you, i didnt know that that would make a difference"
704,glad we could help
704,<@Gabriele> <@Meg> :+1:; so that is a general python rule then? that if it has the () at the end it will run it regardless?
704,"depends, really; is it being passed as an argument to a method that is expecting a function or method?; or is it to be executed at that point?"
704,the `()` means 'call this function immediately'; so you're assigning the result of that function call to `command`
704,ahhhh
704,when you really want to assign the _function itself_ to `command`
704,"right, makes sense to me; it shouldnt be called instantly, since it is a button and should only be called when pressed; so no (); got it!"
704,"however, there are places where you do need the function to be called right away; for example, django url definitions with class based views; you have to use the `.as_view()` call when mapping a view class to a URL, or it won’t work"
704,"yeah, sometimes you have to call a function which returns the function you want to assign. functions returning functions. :slightly_smiling_face:"

&gt;&gt;&gt; past_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=2)

710,is anyone familiar with Behave Testing ?
711,"Hey guys. 
I screwed up some stuff when hacking and slashing some name changes of classes and file names. 
How can I go back to my last commit/push ?; I haven't added anything or commited since last night and I wanna to back to that point.; Delete everything and clone the repo?"
712,"Hi, does anyone have any experience in using aiohttp 2.0+ vs. sanic as a HTTP server?"
711,<@Gisela> if you haven't commited: `git reset &amp;&amp; git checkout`
711,Thanks! checkout was what I was missing!
712,<@Adalberto> I use aiohttp and it get the job done. didn't try sanic
711,"sanic is a microframework, and as such it's easier to work with"
712,<@Ciera> do you use it for a full webserver or only for slower endpoints? Are you using it with an ORM?
711,we use it for all our API. Without any ORM pure sql
711,"OK, and just a very basic async question: what happens if I try to use a blocking ORM like Sqlalchemy ORM in an async app? As normal db requests are so fast, would it be a problem that it blocks?"
712,Well it's best to use a non blocking one obviously. There is some work on making sqlalchemy work with asyncio; for example this <https://github.com/CanopyTax/asyncpgsa> by <@Signe> but it's only for sqlalchemy core
711,"wait, what parts of ORM are inherently blocking?; I thought ORM was an abstraction over Core which by itself does nothing; Or it's just too complex to sort out at once?"
711,no idea
711,"Well, if you call a function that returns some objects, that function doesn't return until the objects are available, so that counts as blocking in some sense"
711,I think people are trying to focus on core first as it's the most important part
711,"true that, even Core is fantastic"
711,I think Core is now async and only ORM is the problem. Also there is a great article by Mike: <http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/>
711,"great article, in which he says he doesn't care about async and nobody should :confused:"
711,"<@Suellen> yes, it's a bit strange that he says that. But he also recommends gevent to solve the same problems, and some long time Python users told me that using gevent is insane in production."
711,It's pretty clear from the Core docs that it's not intrinsically an async API
711,"gevent isn't really insane, it has a looong history and is stable"
711,This reply: <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pylons-discuss/hI9zY4JYBU4/yNGGbE-IAgAJ>
711,but it IS a very non-native approach; funny that he says it's inappropriate to use async with databases; when threads are just async functions from the POV of the OS
711,fyi this might be more a topic for <#C07G5276F|async> :slightly_smiling_face:
711,sorry mr admin
711,haha well it's also that I'm sure some people in <#C07G5276F|async> might have good arguments on this topic and not sure they are all in here

714,Does `print(img.mode)` show ARGB?
714,it's rgb
714,`img = img.convert('ARGB')`; otherwise there is no transparency channel
714,"is this before or after saving, note I have two saves; one for creating the file the other for editing to transparent"
714,"what do you mean?; you can't set a transparent pixel on an image that doesn't have a transparency (alpha) channel; you need to convert from RBG to ARBG before you put a tranparent pixel there; and obviously when you save, you should use a format that supports alpha channels. For example png."
714,"ValueError: conversion from RGB to ARGB not supported; img.convert('ARGB')
		img.save(random_name, ""PNG"")"
714,try RGBA; I forgot a proper name :slightly_smiling_face:; `img.convert('RGBA')` -- the image gets converted to RGBA and you throw the result away; `img = img.convert('RGBA')`
714,yes that was it works :slightly_smiling_face:
715,"I am writing a Python program part of which authenticates with OAuth 1.0 to access a privileged API. I have figured out how to get the authorization URL. After signing in, the browser redirects to <http://localhost> which I registered as the callback with the provider. How do I get the request to localhost and continue with my bot? I figure I need to have a http server of some sort. I would rather not install a full Apache server. What is a lightweight alternative that can receive the request and forward the token to my bot code to continue with API calls?"
714,<@Sidney> <https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#module-http.server>; you can spin up a simple http server using only stdlib; are you sure you even need to accept a request at all?

714,"I only ask because, for example, you can auth on Reddit using OAuth without a redirect or a callback"

714,2
714,"That might be one of the differences.; Or more likely, I'm completely misunderstanding how this works.; <@Suellen> Thanks for the link. Keeping everything in python and in the same codebase will definitely make this easier to manage. I'll look into that library further."
714,"<@Sidney> There are often 2 different authentication flows available - one for clients, and one for servers. Make sure you're using the right one for your situation"

720,"does anybody use PyCharm? When I switch tabs, I want   Run/Debug in the upper right corner to change automatically. Now I have to manually select the file which I want to Run/Debug everytime I switch a tab."
720,"it won’t; pycharm usually has the last run execution as the top option in the dropdown; but you can right click in the file after changing the tab and select Run or Debug; if that’s something that you would find handy to have, you can submit a feature request at <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY>; but a major problem for that is most run configurations are project based, not file based"
720,"yes, but don't you agree that it is silly for PyCharm, which is one of the best Python IDE's, to not have that option?"
720,¯\_(ツ)_/¯; make a feature request
720,How many times have I ran the wrong file :slightly_smiling_face:
720,right click -&gt; run; and then the list will be re-ordered
720,"yeah, I know, I'am using that option...I will submit a request"
720,"for me, it would be an absolutely useless feature; because I’m project-based, not file based"
720,why is that?
720,"so, if I keep changing files and tabs in a project, I don’t want to run the current file; I want to run the entire project; so if I have a django or flask project going on, and I edit the models file.  I don’t want the run configuration to automatically switch to running that file, vs the project run configuration I already have active"
720,"ohh...I am a absolute beginner, so I find that lack of option strange and unintuitive"
720,"ah, ok.  for you, it might make more sense to have that kind of option.  But I would suspect that for the vast majority of pycharm users, that would result in unintended side effects like how I described above; also, consider the fact that each file might have different interpreter and run arguments; so that would require you to create a run configuration for each file; if you switch over to a file that has no configuration set up, how would it behave?"
720,different interpreter? Why would someone want to change the interpreter?
720,one file runs on 3.5; other runs on 3.6.2; or you need to pass in a different argument to the interpreter
720,backward compatible?
720,"so, what pycharm lets you do is define interpreter configurations, where you can define interpeter executable paths or virtualenvs; and then apply in run config; so, for one project, if you need it to be backwards compatible, you can have a run config pointing to your 3.6 environment; named `project 3.6`; and another `project 3.5`; now, if you’re flipping from file to file intending to run it against a specific interpreter version, re-ordering the run configuration options will mess you up; and introduce a non-intuitive UI; so, from a UI experience, think about this; how much extra complexity will implementing your workflow introduce into the UI, and how to handle the edge cases?; compared to how many users this is actually targeted for?"
720,"I cannot fully understand you, but wouldn't it be logical when the file changes, interpreter for that specific file changes too?; In other words, when you change the file, Run configuration for that file changes too"
720,no; because pycharm is intended to be project based run configuration; not file based
720,"ok, I will get that later maybe, when I run into such problems :slightly_smiling_face: Do you have a time to help me with some code. I am building a simple calculator, about 25 lines of code"
720,ask here.  I suspect I’m not the only one around here now :slightly_smiling_face:
720,"I have made it, but I want to make it more efficient....; ok, the question is...how do I print dictionary value, if some variable is the same as dictionary key?; when that variable is found in dictionary, and it matches the dictionary key, I want the program to print the dictionary value that is associated with that key that matches that variable"
720,"you mean something like a dict `{'a'=0, 'b'=1, 'c'=3}` and  a variable `lookup_key = 'a'`?"
720,give me a few minutes to translate the code in english
720,no problem.  What’s your native language?
720,"Serbian; ```while True:
    print(
        ""Welcome to our shitttttty calculator. First, choose two numbers, the choose the operation."")

    first_number = float(input(""Enter the first number: ""))
    second_number = float(input(""Enter the second number: ""))

    dictionary1 = {""addition"": first_number + second_number, ""substraction"": first_number - second_number,
              ""multiplication"": first_number * second_number, ""division"": first_number / second_number }

    user_input= str(input(""Choose your operation: ""))

    if user_input in dictionary1:
        print(dictionary1.items())
        break```"
720,"so, its `user_input` you’re looking for?"
720,"yes; I want to...; when user_input matches a key in dictionary1 (when their values are matched) , then to print the value of that matched key; I don't know how to target that"
720,"so, `dict` has a few methods on it that you would find useful here.  first, `items()` returns a tuple of `key, value`.  Also, `key()` returns a list of the keys, and `values()` does the same for values; so, here, you would want to leverage `keys()` for your `if user_input` conditional; for example, with your dict above, `addition in dictionary1.keys()` returns `True`"
720,"yes, I googled that a little, and I know that it returns the whole list of values and keys, but I want that one specific value from dictionary, not all of them..."
720,"alright; so, if you have `if user_input in dictionary1.keys()`:; and `addition` is user_input; so, you know `addition` is a key in the dict; how do you access keys with a dict?; `dictionary1[user_input]`"
720,"hey all, if anyone has any experience with selenium I've got a quick question I just posted in learning_python"
720,thanks...I did not know that I can target values outside of dictionary...
720,"oh, yes.; but remember, in order to get a value from a dict, you either have to know the key beforehand; eg, `dictionary`[‘addition’]`; or loop through it and doing some comparison"
720,aha...makes sense...
720,"if you want to simplify things, you can use list comprehensions

`[value for key, value in dictionary1.items() if key == user_input]`; which returns a list of matches"
720,"I came from more then a  year discrete math course, and I thought the transition would be much more easier. The most difficult thing in programming so far has been the understanding how the language actually works, quirks, what am I allowed and not allowed to do..."
720,"yup; there are two major difficulties, I feel; one: describe what you want to do in discrete steps; two, use the language syntax and tools to replicate the project steps; first language, you typically struggle with both at the same time, because you need to get the syntax and how to use it to do what you want; but after that, its easier to pick up another one"
720,"yes, exactly, number two is a bigger problem now :slightly_smiling_face:"
720,"like for me, I originally started in java; and there were lots of times where I felt I was paying the university for nothing more than to feel like an idiot"
721,"I was considering to start in Java, there are more jobs, more mature language, static typing, etc. But as soon as I saw hello world in Java and Python, I made my decision :smile:"
720,"java and python have alot of good things; I’m equally comfortable wokrking in both; but then, I’m a full stack dev in both languages; everything from server configuration all the way to css styling for a web application"
720,"java seems okay to me, but java developers often overcomplicate things"
720,"Do you have Skype, email, facebook, or some other tools of communication where  I can ask you something when I get really stuck? :slightly_smiling_face:"
720,"like when they have a single class (a custom service sdk) with a bunch of methods to test, they're likely to
a) create the sdk interface (even if it's obvious there won't be an other implementation)
b) create the abstract base class implementing the interface (even there won't be more than one subclass, ever)
c) repeat a and b for the testing suite (!)"
720,"yep; all that is implemented ad nauseaum in the spring framework; architecture astronauts :slightly_smiling_face:; just ask here, to be honest"
720,"Oh, if only in the spring framework. Much likely in an in-house, custom framework which won't have many nice integrations and features spring provides"
720,"because I’m not really a mentor, nor do I have the time to be.  Also, being part of the community here means you get to ask questions and then as you get better, contribute back"
720,"sure, I understand"
720,"I’ve only worked on two large java projects.  one was in spring, other was in google web toolkit with a custom in-house library; and honestly, the in-house library was about 100KLOC of some of the best code I’ve ever read.  Sure, there were some warts in it that I was glad I didn’t have to implement, but overall the code quality was extremely high.  Most of the problems came with integrating with GWT.. so glad I don’t have to do that anymore"
720,You're lucky then
720,"I guess what I’m trying to say is in a community like this, you get more resources from multiple people than just relying on one person :slightly_smiling_face:"
720,"I'm definitely fan of a very specific, well-written, tested in-house library that does the thing"
720,"To be fair, originally a lot of that was pretty much required for proper unit test mocking ; In Java/spring"
720,"None of that applies to our current developers, unfortunately"
720,"no, I was not really looking for a mentor, I was looking for someone to answer some  questions when I get stuck,  5-10 minutes max, but as you said, I can get that help on the <#C07EFMZ1N|help> channel...maybe I was thinking that you are the only living person on that channel :smile:"

723,"Does anyone know how i can split this string into multiple parts ```'media/Clearance.png?sometexthere'``` ideally i'd like just the Clearance.png; so if i was splitting it it'd be 'media/', 'Clearance.png' and '?sometexthere'; I have ```f = imgString.split('medias/')[1]
g = f.split('?')[0]

723,"If it's always a similar format you could regex it and get the groups, but that's less obvious and I'd favor a few lines to a single line if it isn't as clean "
723,"Yeah the image name will change, but media/ and ? stay the same, i'll probs stick to what i have, it works so :smile:"
724,do you have the full path available?

I've gotten this `transcribe_streaming_mic.py` to work. But I'm a little confused with if I should be using async vs sync.... and how to modify this for my use case. I want to only collect up to five seconds of data at a time with the ability to short circuit the `listen_print_loop` if a certain condition is met. I'm think I can put a timer around the `with MicrophoneStream` and I can have the listen_print_loop(responses) throw an exception when it meets a certain condition (timeout= 5 seconds, or correct response). Catch this response in the main and do something based upon it.

Stackoverflow Question Link
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43247818/error-in-converting-ipython-notebook-file-to-pdf>"
730,Could someone explain this whole tox.ini thing? Is that just for linters and coverage? Will mypy follow it? Is it deprecated?; <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> seems to make it like tox is all about unit testing
730,"It's useful when you need to test your codebase against a matrix of dependencies; i.e. you webapp supports Django 1.11, 1.10 and 1.9; and it also works with Python 2.7 and 3.3+; just `make test` or `py.test` will only test against your current configuration"
730,or to run multiple test one after another :slightly_smiling_face:
730,"Right now, with my django tests, I'm using manage.py test, but that's inside of the env. I guess you'd use tox as an alternative to starting a specific venv and running the tests; What confused me intiially is that I do use a tox.ini file, but only for flake8 ignores and coverage omit's; but I can't seem to use it for mypy, I need a mypy.ini for that"
730,as tox is widely use some tools allow you to put their configuration inside the `tox.ini` file to limit the number of configuration file; I have no idea if mypy allow that; there might be a command line arg to pass the configuration file
730,"Mypy could easily add pattern matching for that, but I don't think it does; (hard to prove a negative :))"
730,<https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/2761>; so it's seem :bdfl: was against it in the beginning then change his mind
730,"His opinion certainly is reasonable; btw, separate topic, why do so many programs not come with man pages? Have nobody done it yet, or are people against it? (thiis is a very general question)"
730,python program ? or in general ?
730,in general
730,nobody :nose:
730,"for mypy for example, guido himself said ""no it's too complicated"" here: <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2599>
but there's a thousand big projects missing manpages; (not literally ""too complicated"")"
730,well if it's for using the output of the `--help` I don't really see a need; and as he said it creates more complexity to release; maybe if there was a way to generate man page from sphinx doc

731,"Hi there, I'm kinda new in the ""do the stuff by yourself"". Since I broke up with school books and tasks so, I started a little project in Python, a Bible Verse Searcher (It's my first Python Project, and it will be donated to my local church, ¡Yay!)...

Apart from the boring part, I'm trying to parse the XML of the Bible in a Finder class, but I got this:
```Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""Documents/Universidad/Python/Bible/BibleSearcher.py"", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;

    source = open(source, ""rb"")
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'RVR1960.xml'  ```

You can say, ""You don't have the freaking XML in the same folder, you big dummy!"" but I have it, actually. Do you have an idea what's going on here?; And, if someone has ideas to make this program interesting (functionality) I'll be thankful if you share them with me, :smile:"
731,"The XML might be in the _same_ folder, but that isn't necessarily the folder that the program is running from"
731,"So, full path is the solution?"
731,Maybe; You get to decide where you run a program from.
731,full path is always better :slightly_smiling_face:
731,"Well, I got this: ```FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~/Documents/Universidad/Pyhon/Bible/RVR1
960.xml'   ```"
731,typo
731,I don't get this... :disappointed:
731,Pyhon vs. Python
731,Still not getting it :S
731,you have typed the path incorrectly
731,"Well, You have to know, I'm not running it whitin a venv :see_no_evil:; Oh"
731,which is at least one argument against using a full path
731,You think maybe a solution could be setting up a venv?; Or makes no difference :confused:
731,Your most immediate solution is just to type that path out correctly.; Your second solution is to work out why you seem to be running the program from somewhere other than where the XML file is.
731,"Ok I found the full path, thanks... Tacos but, still thinking about the venv, maybe that's a better solution (beginner with that stuff, don't know if the venv really matters); :taco: <@Gabriele>; And, if yes, I have a serious problem because I just moved from atom to MacVim :S; And I'm kinda new using it so, I don't know anything about running venv's in vim."
731,Virtualenvs wouldn't really change the nature of this problem. Mostly it just ensures that your libraries are exactly what you want them to be.
731,"Oh, nevermind then... Thanks again, bro; Ok, another question (I really need to wonder if I really learned Python)... Uhhh; I have this:
```import xml.etree.ElementTree as et

class Finder():
    version = 'RVR1960' # Default version in Spanish Bible
    tree = et.parse('/Users/alfonsoima/Documents/Universidad/Python/Bible/RVR1960.xml')
    bible = tree.getroot()

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def find(book = ""Génesis"", chv = ""1:1""):
        try:
            cha, ver = chv.split(':')
        except:
            cha = chv
            ver = '1'
        finally:
            return bible.find('./b[@n=""{}""]/c[@n=""{}""]/v[@n=""{}""]'.format(book, cha, ver))
```
And the shell prompts this:
`NameError: name 'bible' is not defined `; So, I tried with the `global bible` then `return bible.find(args)` but still didn't work.; And `self.bible` neither works."
731,"your class isn’t being created properly. Your `def find()` method has no ‘self’ being passed into it so it would need to be decorated with `@staticmethod`.; i would suggest structuring you class a little differently. I would pass in that full path like so

```
class Finder(object):
    def __init__(self, version, xml_path):
        self.version = version
        self.xml_path = xml_path
        self.tree = et.parse(xml_path)
        self.bible = tree.getroot()

    def find(self, book, chv):
        try:
            cha, ver chv.split()
        except SomeError:
            cha = chv
            ver = '1'
        finally:
            . . . 
```; then you can do 

```
finder = Finder('1.0', '/path/to/xml_file.xml')
book = finder.find(book='Genesis', chv='1:1')
```; <@Lana> :point_up:"
731,Why am I so bad structuring this stuff while you guys are awesome?; :taco: <@Johana>
731,"it’s just experience :wink:.; you’ll get there.; you may also want to start introducing some assumptions for sanity’s sake.; for example an app/script that finds things in bible xml should be able to safely assume where the files are located…; i think having to specify the full_path is unnecessary. could offer a way for the user to override this behavior by doing this:

```
def __init__(self, xml_path=None):
    if xml_path:
        self.xml_path = xml_path
    else:
        self.xml_path = '/path/to/file'
```"
731,"Sounds awesome...; And, about the experience, I have ~1 year and... Nothing I can say :stuck_out_tongue:"
731,scripts never die so it’s best to design them in a way you can run them and they work for the most part b/c 3 months from now you might not remember :wink:.; i love having defaults that just work.
732,The Bible was written in XML?; TIL
732,Think it was originally written in YAML and King James converted it to XML
733,"Hello, I have mind problem with TDD using mock. 
I can't just break through this: 
How can I write test before my code using mocking if I'm not exactly sure what I want to use?
It's nice when You're testing behavior of something but when it comes to use some side-effect generating objects it's unbreakable wall for me.
I know how to write unittest, mock things .etc but I don't really know how to do testing before code when 
I'm not sure what will fit best.
For example when I'm using paramiko to do some sftp staff I simply can't predict every thing I do because I don't really know this lib enough. (Well, I know paramiko, this is just example :D)
When I'm trying stuff and checking how it works... well I'm ending up with already created solution... and then pre-testing is becoming a post-testing which shouldn't be done in TDD

halp
:confused:"
733,"<@Carie> I think you'd generally do best by ""wrapping"" the external lib and then testing those functions, you can define a noop function and write tests around it (obviously they fail immediately). Then you integrate the external lib into those functions (so none of your main app code uses the external lib, since that's an ""implementation detail"") and keep going until it's passing."

732,<@Eartha> if you wanna make rest api I’d recommend you don’t use verbs in urls and use http methods instead
735,"`from typing import Iterable, Iterator, Sequence`

An iterator describes the actual iterator object (e.g. what you get back when you run `iter(some_list)`).
An Iterable is some object `xs` that you can do `for x in xs: ...`
A Sequence describes an object `xs` that is an Iterable that also allows you to grab a specific element, e.g. `xs[4]` (that is, xs has a `__getitem__` method defined). An Iterable MAY have `__getitem__`, but a Sequence MUST have it.

Correct?; So, when I'm annotating a function, I could use Iterable if I want some duck typing and I know that I won't be accessing a specific member of the object, but I have to use Sequence if I ever access a specific member (e.g. I'll run `xs[-1]` at some point, if xs is the object we're annotating)"
735,seems correct
735,"This is all in the context of type annotations btw, which is why the official definitions as found in the docs might not match up; I really wish that the Callable type annotation was more advanced... It'd be cool if I could for example create a NewType for a Django view function, being a ""Callable whose first argument is HttpRequest, ignoring all the other aspects"". Right now the annotation is `Callable[[arg1, arg2], return_type]`, but there's no way of doing e.g. `Callable[[HttpRequest, ...], Any]`"
735,<@Lanita> why would you annotate a django's view function?
735,"<@Collette>, it would make it clearer when writing e.g. decorators"
735,"<@Lanita> this is a very, very specific use-case. I doubt it's worth it to introduce a custom syntax to handle this case (imo, a good type checker should infer all necessary information automatically), but you can always open a feature request"
735,"<@Collette> No, it's not anywhere near ""very very"" user specific. This is a standard part of python function definition syntax. E.g. doing `def f(some_arg, *rest_of_args)`; Being able to annotate that function as `Callable[[type(some_arg), ...], Any]` would be neat; It's also common when ""overloading"" methods in classes, e.g. class A has `def some_method(arg1)`, class B which inherits from class A has `def some_method(arg1, extra_arg)`; example of similar things proposed: <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3157>"
735,"<@Lanita> you're implying that type annotations should be everywhere. No, they don't.
It would be good if `typing` would support that use-case, but to me it doesn't seem so much critical at all."
736,"That's why I proposed you to create a feature request, and looks like it's created already by someone else"
735,"Well multiple people clearly think otherwise, as proven by the various issues on mypy with positive response regarding this subject..."
735,"Even more people haven't participated in these issues, who may have another opinion. But let's not discuss that.

Again, I'm not against this feature. I just think that
a) annotating everything will destroy one of the most important features of python (to me) - readability,
b) therefore it would be better to improve static type checkers to infer as much as possible;
c) however, I think we can live without type checking in this specific use-case because we lived without `typing` module for a quite long time and sky didn't fall, but
d) it won't hurt anyone if this feature is supported. Some folks will definitely find it useful."
737,"I have a string with a method name in it, I'm looking for a way to call that function on an instanced object identifying the method by the name of the string.

This somewhat works, but is ugly as can be:
```instance.__class__.__dict__[method_name](instance)```
Except, these are inherited objects, and inherited methods aren't accessible.

There must be a better way.; Actually, it looks like ```getattr``` will do that. Slightly less ugly."
737,maybe something like:
737,"Yeah, that's what I found. It will work. Thanks.; A lot cleaner than the mess I had above."
737,"No problem, you beat me to it!; if you expect this behavior, you may be able to add methods to class that operate on state of instance"
737,I'm not sure what you mean.
737,"you’re operating on an instance of a class, why not write a method on instance to take in `self`?"
737,I'm still not sure what you mean. Example code?
737,"This is what im thinking, but I don’t actually know what your function is doing."
737,"Sorry, got distracted.

I see what you are saying. I think the getattr fits what I'm doing better.; I realize I didn't describe how I got there, so it makes it difficult. It is just a lot of code across different modules.

But, it's from a modular gui in kivy that is listing a pretty version of a method name, the user selects what objects, and from there what methods to run, and kivy then sends on the list of strings. It's been interesting, for sure."

No shading is happening...; `x2 = array([989971200000000000,` ..... `990057360000000000, 990057480000000000], dtype=int64)`"
744,that's your problem there; because you need to compare on the actual values in `x2`; try `where=numeric_timestamp in x2`
744,So I should make a new list and check if the *numeric* timestamps are in there?
744,"no need.  look at my example above; ah, correction; yes; you can use a list comprehesion for that"
744,"Something like this?
`where=[x for x in x2 if x in list]`"
744,"so, the `where` param uses a comparison to evaulate as true/false to determine where fill happens; if you pass in a list of values, it needs something to compare with; and the `in` keyword does an exact match; <https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill_between.html>; ah, correction.; pass in the list there; but you'd have to do it with a division and comparison"
744,"I know. I just did that to make more red fill, so I can know if it works or not; I want to chart to be shaded between 7am and 10am; Oh I misread what you said. nvm"
744,eg `where = [x for x in x2 if x &gt; numeric_timestamp/2 ]`
744,Where numeric_timestamp is my chosen value
746,Hey everyone! Bit stuck on something. I'm using a nested list comprehension to retrieve data from a generator returned by a method in a tool I'm building. It seems a bit wasteful to do so - would using ```next()``` be more suitable for working with generators?
744,"<@Jon> correct.  In your code example, `numeric_timestamp = 990014340000000000`"
744,"<@Meg>, I dont know if I'm missing something now...

I did `(x2[0] + x2[-1])/2` and got `9.9001434e+17`
So then I did `ax1.fill_between(x2, 0, 100, where = [x for x in x2 if x &gt; 9.9001434e+17/2 ], facecolor='red', alpha=0.5)`

It's plotting, but there is no shading
If I remove the `/2`, I get `ValueError: Argument dimensions are incompatible`"

744,<@Davida> could you share some code ? :slightly_smiling_face:
744,"<@Jon> is there a way you can check the list values outside of the `fill_between`?; eg, `[x for x in x2 if x &gt; 9.9001434e+17/2 ]` in the shell"
746,<@Ciera> will do - I need to genericise it first though :stuck_out_tongue: (work project)
744,what values are there
744,"I'm using jupyter, but I can do that in a new cell"
744,"<@Davida> when you're asking for help, code always makes things easier; since we don't know what you're doing"
746,<@Lana> is it maybe an additional thing to install ? I suppose `import kivy` is working ?
746,"<@Ciera> I'm an idiot, just pressed enter to this channel with my question and realized `kivy.uix.Widget ≠ kivy.uix.widget`"

`x2.shape` = `(720,)`
`len([x for x in x2 if x &gt; 9.9001434e+17/2 ])` = 720; I think I need a masked boolean array
Or what do you call it"
744,"<@Meg> noted. I need to be wary of being too specific, but I'll do what I can; <@Ciera> see below

```

744,"Because `len([x for x in x2 if x &gt; 990002640000000000 ])` = 457
So then it complains that the dimensions differ. I guess it expects 720 values
<@Meg>"
744,"That gives me a set of values as such:

```
[log_ID, log_ID, log_ID, log_ID}
```"
746,":taco: Anyway, thanks <@Ciera>"
744,"Again, I'm starting to practice everyday so, still kinda new :S"
744,<@Ciera> I was thinking of simplifying that giant list comp by using ``` next(groups)``` instead but not sure if that'd work
746,<@Lana> we have all been there :wink:
746,Thanks again
744,"<@Davida> I don't know but, is not the `next()`method callable when you use `yield`instead of `return`?"
746,there is definitively a better way <@Davida> jsut need to find it :smile:
746,"Oh, I just scrolled up, you know that, sorry"
744,"<@Lana> not necessarily, according to the docs (<https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#next>) it's callable on any iterator. I am unsure whether a generator is different to an iterator, though - that's where I'm kind of :scream: ing

744,"<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>; but yeah, no MD formatting is a bit of a PITA; <@Davida> basically, a generator is an iterator, but an iterator is not a generator"

744,would somehting like that work `[x[2] for x in list_logs(...)]`
744,"that would work, yes!"

747,"Hello everyone! I am building a desktop application that will be uploading images to amazon S3 using `boto3`. However I haven’t figured out the best way to store the credentials to access the bucket.

I have created a IAM User with only the PutObject policy, but how can I request the credentials for this user without having to store it in a file or hardcode it? Any ideas?"
747,"<@Cecelia> Is the app being distributed to end users, or just for yourself?"
747,You can store them in env variables in os as far as i remember
747,It is being distributed
747,"The problem with distributing them is that then any user can generate signed requests for uploads to the bucket (if your policy is set well, that may be okay - but I don't think the policy allows you to control sizes). But most cases of boto3 usage I see are webdev (vs desktop) - so I am not sure on the ""best practice"" other than to maybe have a web-service that generates the presigned urls"
747,"that would probably be best, IMO; have the web service as a middleman; upload the file(s) to the server, which then would put directly to S3"
747,"Would then only asking the server for a session token be sufficient?; The files are specific and generated, being around 100KB, so size won’t be a problem.; This way I can store the credentials in env variables"
747,"I don't see how asking for a session token is different than the pre-signed URL, which would be the route I would go (that way the load is between the client computer and AWS, not your web service)"

749,"Hello everybody, I am going to start a new project soon and I've decided to settle for Django. However, I have absolutely no experience in Python, Django &amp; any kind of hosting beside fully-managed VPS or shared. Now, since the beginning of my ""learning"" journey, I've stumbled across many tutorials that were for Linux &amp; I also read about some Python libraries that were not compatible with Windows at all... So I would like to know if I should install a Linux partition to start my project (which would add another layer of complexity since I haven't touched Linux since ~10 years). Would it be worth it to take the time to install Ubuntu, learn how it works and how to set up the hosting or would I be perfectly fine just staying on Windows with PyCharm (here though, I am quite scared about the moment where we will have to deploy in production xD) Thanks!"
750,"You’ll definitely want to get a bit of a sense for how it’ll be hosted and learn some of the ins and outs of it.; But I don’t know that you need to go as far as installing Ubuntu - I’d recommend Docker.  It has its own learning curve (although personally I don’t find it to be that steep); But it’ll allow you to work in Windows, but run the application in the same Linux environment it will run in on the server"
750,So you would recommend Docker and not Vagrant?
750,and it allows you to pull in things easily like Postgres or Redis; definitely; if you were experienced with Linux and this was going to be something else to pile on then I might say it’s not worth it
750,"lol ok, I don't know anything about these tools, but I'd like to not waste my time learning something useless haha"
750,"But you’ll need to learn how it’s going to be hosted, and in my opinion investing the time learning docker rather than running linux and how to put all the rest of it together that way will take you a lot further"
750,cool
750,"there are plenty of docker lovers here and in <#C22DMH61M|devops> too, so if you get stuck and need help, just ask"
750,do you know if hosts can usually help with this?; it's free?
750,"Docker itself is free (the community edition at least, but that’s all you need); Hosting it of course will require you to pay somebody, but docker has some nice tools to get you running with that on AWS or other cloud providers"
750,We're on a VPS
750,Are you tied to this VPS?
750,"Hmmm, I wouldn't say so, but to start the project we'll be using it since my friend is already paying it for his (small) WP site"
750,"If you sign up for AWS you get a decent amount of free tier credit.; I’d recommend against sharing the hosting with other things, especially WordPress."
750,For security?
750,"yeah security, ease of management, etc."
750,"The issue I ran into when I was checking hosts like Heroku, AWS was that it seems like people ends up paying a ton... So I checked DO, which looked nice but it's not managed. After, I found WebFaction and my friend already had a managed VPS on HostWinds so we thought it would be a good start lol"
750,"A lot can be done on Heroku on the free tier actually; And I mean yeah you can end up paying a ton on AWS as you scale up, but honestly at the kind of scale that becomes an issue it’s not really feasible to be doing this sort of stuff on managed VPS boxes"
750,"Oh; So it might be possible for me to make the project on free Heroku to showcase it, then move it or scale up"
750,yup
750,"I will look into this; It's a bit scary though lol, with the Dynos and the Databases and everything seems to be customizable haha..."
750,ha.  it’s not so bad.
750,Im used to run PHP with MySQL/PHPMyAdmin on a shared hosting :stuck_out_tongue:
750,"it’s mostly a terminology issue, they complicate things with these crazy names like “dyno”; this stuff, in a sense, isn’t much different than what you did.  a “dyno” on heroku is basically just an instance of your application; and you put some files in standardized places so it knows how to run it; the big difference between running a python (or ruby or node) type web app and something like PHP via say Apache is that in Python you’ll usually run the application and have a webserver connect to via its ip address; so the user talks to say, Apache, like normal, and then instead of running mod_php or whatever inside apache, it will run what’s called a reverse proxy and send the connections to your web application’s ip and port"
750,oh; that sounds weird to me lol
750,"ha.  it does seem kind of weird at first, but it can be beneficial, because for example you can have many workers behind a simple reverse proxy; and it’s also possible to develop locally without needing the whole big heavy apache server"
750,"well, weird or not, I am very interested in both Python and NodeJS so gotta learn haha; I saw that Django seems to come with a kind of webserver on its own"
750,"yup, so that the reverse proxy can connect to it; and so you can develop locally"
750,"I see; So, my learning stack would be: Docker -&gt; Heroku -&gt; Python -&gt; Django?"
750,"That’s up to you - you probably could get started with Django on Windows without too much fuss.; But in my experience things like Node or Python projects do tend to be more oriented towards unix like operating systems, so problems can arise.; So yeah, to your original point, putting things in Ubuntu would help there.; But there’s a learning cost, so in my opinion it’s worth it to just learn Docker instead, it’ll give you the same benefits and so many more.; And then too when you go to deploy the site, you can rest easy knowing you are deploying the same thing you developed on."
750,Docker and Python have some decent courses on Pluralsight if you have a subscription.  The Django course there is kinda old now
750,"Yeah... I am not very good in the ""sys"" side so the faster I can start coding, the faster I will be comfortable building the site lol xD"
750,"oh that’s a good idea, yeah a course like that might help jumpstart things a bit"
750,I don't have an inscription but they give a 10 days free trial
750,"and that’s sort of the interesting thing too - Docker seems to many to be “advanced” but I actually think it helps do a good job of obfuscating a lot of the sys admin stuff pretty well; so that in the end that yes, you need to learn this tool, but things overall get a lot simpler."
750,okay; well I suppose I could deal with Docker at the same time as I learn about Heroku; hum <@Britteny> do you have any specific course for Docker to recommend on pluralsight? There's like 63... xD
750,"yeah, make sure you feel comfortable with a simple hello world django app locally first"
750,"Getting Started with Docker - was good; Also, for Python “Python Fundamentals” and “Python – Beyond the Basics” really helped me"
750,oh nice they are much shorter than Udemy too lol
750,"Beyond the Basics is longer, but in my opinion there is no filler.  It’s all great stuff.  Actually, Beyond the Basics I think is the best screencast I’ve seen"
750,Hey guys; Could you list the most typical questions on python interview?
750,Is python pass by reference or value?
750,I think that’d largely depend on the position
750,I am applying to back-end role
750,"Junior, or senior?"
750,by value;); Middle
750,not all arguments are by value
750,"Explain the HTTP Request/Response process; Describe RESTful APIs, HTTP verbs, idempotent, etc"
750,"actually a common related question is about mutable default arguments, since many people don’t realize that each time a function or method is instantiated, it gets a reference to the same object; so if you have `foo(bar=[])` and modify bar in foo, each run of foo() will be modifyin the same default bar; MVC architecture will often come up, as well as perhaps some questions about [No]SQL or any ORMs you have experience with."
750,"Definitely, also maybe some basic SQL, joins, 3rd normal form, etc"
750,"CORS, CSRF tokens, other security related questions might come up as well.; mid-level is tough for both the interviewer and the interviewee because a mid-level is naturally not going to know certain things"
750,"I’m finding this kind of interesting.  When I interview these days, which has only really been for seniors recently, I’m generally looking for qualities above and beyond technical skills.  Your CV and Github / provided code should give evidence of that, and then I just want to understand  -how you solve problems, how do you learn something new, how do you work with your colleagues, how curious are you, how enthusiastic are you, when do you ask for help versus research on your own, etc"
750,yeah I certainly have moved away from a focus on very technical interview questions
750,"I find I ask no more than about 25 mins of tech questions, but then drop in stuff like ‘Have you seen the new feature in Node 8, what’s your opinion of async/await versus promises’; (we are mainly a JS environment)"
750,yeah I think that’s a good approach.  give people a topic and let them run with it and they’ll tell you a lot about themselves
750,"I like the async/await vs promises, basically language features, or differences between languages even and get their opinion"
750,I also like to talk to people about projects they’ve worked on in a very conversational manner.  I find it can tell a lot
750,"I usually ask stuff about what they're into, what excites them, their favorite projects they've been on"
750,"All of the above, yeah.  If they can’t talk coherently about the design choices and trade-offs they’ve made, then they’re not really fluent enough with the tech; For a senior role; I’ve not interviewed for juniors in 10 years, which is a bit sad really as we need to do more of that"
750,interviewing a junior is basically flipping a coin. lol
750,"Looks I am the only ""lucky guy"" with questions about big O; and internals of JVM; I am more a Java-developer but also looking for a python role"
750,"Haha.. wow.  I think it depends on who you interview with.  We’re not trying to be google and have the best engineering team.  We want to solve our customer’s problems, even those they haven’t been able to explain to us"
750,"Big O, algorithms, traverse a binary search tree in order, post order, pre order, but then your role has very little to do with that.  I mean I understand needing to know fundamentals but those questions have always bothered me.; But Java roles seem to like those types of questions."
750,Yeah agreed.  And honestly an interviewer asking those sorts of questions to me is a huge red flag about a place.
751,But there are many red flags though
750,I am ok with questions about datastructs and access/search time because you use datastructs every day
750,"yeah, that’s true, there are.  and that’s actually an important thing as a job seeker.  don’t settle for a place raising a bunch of red flags if possible."
751,But writing an optimal solution having 5 minutes when interviewer is near you - it is weird
752,Weird and just not how you do your day to day job.  I'm not what information interviewers think they gleaning from a candidate in those situations.
752,"it's neither by value, nor by reference"
752,"That's always been my issue with smaller companies following suit with the ""Google style"" of interviewing blindly. They fail to realize that these methods are essentially an ongoing experiment executed by organizations that can afford teams the size of companies to crunch the data and adjust processes, and absorb high failure rates (and the corresponding cost) because of their revenue per engineer and never-ending pipeline of candidates due to their size. Google and others are quite open about their attempts to quantify hiring and that it isn't a solved problem. It's all fairly interesting, but many people are too quick to get tunnel vision on the ""best practices"" of hiring and make it awful for the company and the candidate in the process, creating a market for interviewing skills that, like timgraf said, have no direct relation to day-to-day work."

753,"Is there a way to order words in the terminal? (MacOS/Linux)
```
The words looks li
ke this
```
And..
```
I want them
like this
```"
753,not simply like that.; you can take a list of words and sort them with `sort`. but it simply sorts lines from stdout
753,I think I didn't explain myself
753,"❯ echo ""a\nc\nb"" | sort
a
b
c"
753,"I want them not ""sorted"" but without splitting them among lines"
753,ok; can you paste that text in here?
753,"I'll use a lot of texts (actually, it's for a python project I'm working on), use any Bible verse, for example"
753,"yea just a sec; <@Charles> 
```
❯ echo ""i am blah bla bla words just fill asdf asdf \ndoo"" | tr "" "" ""\n"" | sort | tr ""\n"" "" ""
 am asdf asdf bla bla blah doo fill i just words
```; the command `tr` replaces text.; so make all spaces new lines. then simply `sort` them. then make new lines spaces; but also note in this case, you will end up with a blank line. so you may want to make sure that may not happen.; if possible"
753,"Nope, not working :confused:"
753,are you on linux or osx?; whats the error?

753,"ok with the above, what is the expected output; so you also want to remove comments after the hash `#` ?"
753,Nope...
753,oh i see
753,I just want to NOT split the words; That's frustrating for those (including me) who love to read...
753,"ok. thats going to be harder to do intelligently. since what if those are actually 2 different words; such as is it a new line, or is it a ""word wrap"" which isnt a true new line. but to bash it looks like one.; joining the lines is easy. with simply `tr ""\n"" "" ""` its just where to do it and make sure the split words are kept whole."
753,I tried with `tput rmam`; But Terminal just gone crazy
753,yea.
753,"*FINAL*: Just came from MacOS Feedback page, looks like I'm not the only one with this issue (There's no possible solution right now in OSX Terminal or xterm for Linux Users)."
753,unfortunately doing this is easy until you try to keep the words from being split. sorting is the easy part as is joining lines. even in bash.; this isnt a bash issue really. its kind of a machine learning issue. though simple.; as you are trying to detect whole and real words
753,"I'll develop my code to detect the width of the window (In characters) and do the `""\n""`thing when words cannot fill in the current line; hope that works.; Thanks anyway <@Bruno> You made a great effort; You deserve this... :taco: <@Bruno>"
753,"when the word is split is there never a space after it and only a new line? and when the word is NOT split, is there always a space PLUS a new line?; lol thanks"
753,I don't get it
753,"if thats the case, you can change all only new lines with nothing, and space newline with space. so 
```
echo ""..."" | tr "" \n"" "" "" | tr ""\n"" """"
```; so. in your example above.; ```
word 1 word 2 wo
rd 3 # I don't 
want this
```; `wo` is split onto a new line from `rd`. and `don't` is split from another whole word `want` only 1 word is being split there, correct?"
753,I think I'm not getting your explanation
753,"what i mean, if `wo` has no spaces before `rd`, meaning its the same as `wo\nrd`."
753,I just want to disable text-wrapping
753,"and `don't` and `want` is split with a space AND a new line. so that its actually `don't \nwant`; then you could work with that.; since `SPACE` + `\n` always means whole words.; and `\n` by itself, is a slit word"

How do I get that shaded background?"
758,"<@Jon> I think matplotlib is not used by most of the people here; for example, the help yesterday from me was entirely from looking at the documentation and some of stackoverflow; so you may have better results with matplotlib related questions on SO, as you did yesterday; unfortunately, we don’t have a data visualization channel, apparently there hasn’t been a need for it"
758,"<@Jon> Try 

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')

759,Is there a good way to do bulk insert with sql alchemy and handle / ignore / skip duplicate entry errors?
759,use upsert
759,Thanks I'll check it out
759,<https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/db.py#L42-L94>; <@Orpha> :point_up: i have two examples there.
759,I was looking for more of an add_all replacement 
759,add_all ?
759,so right now; i have this in a for loop
759,oh you are using the orm.
759,yea
759,then you will need to use session.merge()
759,"i can take it out of the loop and use add_all; ok, yea i was looking at that just now; im moving files to s3 and storing url in db, but i have to handle duplicates; just incase #clients"
759,i wouldn’t consider that a bulk insert but ok.
759,fair enough
759,through the orm you would have to look through all of them and .merge() them to the system.
759,"i haven’t actually read into it, but im assuming the current way im doing it is bad performance wise"
759,"yea, the fastest thing you’ll get is using the core."
759,sort of like doing a raw insert in a for loop 1000x times
759,Moving the commit out of the loop will likely help a lot
760,"Hi! Does anyone know the way to validate json string without `json.loads`? `eval` is faster, but no :slightly_smiling_face:"
759,yea; it will commit everything at once.; remember that the session is like a recorder.
759,"yea, that was my other question"
759,it records everything in order and executes everything in that order when you do `session.commit()`
759,"is it worth doing a list then add all at once then commit, or just move the commit out"
759,<@Chu> Why don't you want to use `loads`?
759,your loop above is doing an insert statement for every iteration.
759,"I'm receiveing string from client side and need to store in database as is. But I need to know that my json is valid. (There is no way to make json field in db, too large db under load)"
759,it depends <@Orpha>. how many inserts do you suspect?
759,"<@Orpha> If there's no good reason why you need to commit after each one, then don't do it. Usually you would commit after a coherent block of work has been completed. In this case, finishing inserting everything is a logical block of work, I'd say; That doesn't explain why you don't want to use `loads`"
759,It consumes a lot of memory and CPU time in my scale. Looking for optimization.
759,anywhere from 1 to 7k
759,"I don't know of a faster way than to use `loads`, sorry"
759,moving the commit out throws the duplicate entry error
759,the commit won't affect that
759,well… it does
759,did you try .merge instead of .add?
759,"at some point, a commit will happen, and your duplicates will get found"
759,not yet; only tried moving the commit out
759,"moving the commit is to speed things up, that's all"
759,:point_up:
759,:thumbsup:
759,for ultimate performance gains i urge using the core.; but if that isn’t of utmost importance … carry on.
759,"not the most important; so merge needs an existing object?; ah, same duplicate error too"
759,i think so.; yea it will need the id of the entity and it will merge the records.
759,"ah, forget it… ill just leave it as is… it works, and it’s not slow at all… was just bored seeing what other way i could quickly change it to"
759,argh. i keep getting slow connection and connection errors to websites. happens both at home and work. both of which are pretty fast connections. at least 100mpbs. even google search stalls. some times i have to hit the search button again. not connected to vpn. even in incognito window. and other browsers.

761,"could someone help me with this python code? I’m trying to build my own tuple by looping through a list and adding them to the tuple, but something seems wrong and I can’t really figure why:

```

myTuple = (('', ''),)
answers = ['Test1', 'Test2', 'Test3']

l = list(myTuple)

for x in answers:
    l.append((x, x))

widget.choices = (myTuple)```

What i want my widget.choices to look like is 

```widget.choices = (('', ''),('Test1', 'Test1'), ('Test2','Test2'), ('Test3','Test3'))```"
761,"What does `widget.choices` look like in reality? You are modifying a list `l` but then you assign `myTuple` to `widget.choices`. Also know that `(myTuple)` won't make `myTuple` a tuple, if that is what you were thinking the paren would do in that case."
761,Looks like you want a tuple of tuples.; When you're better off using a list of namedtuple; Or any other object that isn't tuple of tuple
761,Looks like your widget.choices is waiting a tuple of tuples…
761,"well I just figured my mistake, I had to give widget.choices `l` instead of `myTuple`"
761,"Anyone know of a way to make the `pd.read_csv` function change the header columns to lower case during import operation?    I'm currently pre-processing each input file to make this happen, but it feels like something that's a common enough problem that I've overlooked a feature.; `pd` being pandas in this scenario; The ordering is important, as you can't be specific about which column names to bring in, if they don't match case."
761,can you be sure there won't be duplicate column names?
761,"Yep, all my datasets are from database dumps of individual tables"
761,"```from collections import namedtuple

example_named_tuple = namedtuple('example_named_tuple', ('val1', 'val2'))
# example call single one
single_tuple = example_named_tuple('','')

# print the list of tuples
print(choices)
# individually
for item in choices:

761,"I think I have one dataset based on Oracle (which loves all uppercase field names), and 10 others which are always lowercase"
761,"I mean, you can do conversion after import, but I don't think the `read_csv` options allow column name case change; I mean, ther eis a `converters` option, but that's just for you to apply functions to convert values in specific columns"
761,"<@Adrian> this way works really well if you need to keep your items intact.; You can apply a lambda function for pandas on import; <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15799>; ```skipcols = [...]
userows = [...]
read_csv(..., usecols=lambda x: x not in skipcols,
              skiprows=lambda x: x not in userows])```; <https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/anonymous-function>

` double = lambda x: x* 2` is equivalent to :

```def double(x):
   return x * 2```"
761,"Ohh, okay, I can make that work.  didn't realize usecols was that flexible"
761,It's really amazing; The reason it's better to use a named tuple is you can preserve your relationship between the first and second item. You don't have to worry about inserting in any order. You can also do things like create a dictionary of named tuples.
761,"<@Adrian> and are you using this for a ChoiceField by chance? It doesn't _have_ to be a tuple I don't think, it just needs to be iterable, so `l` probably works as is"
761,"nice find, <@Glinda> :taco:"
761,"Yes, thanks <@Glinda> :taco:"
761,"Even if it needs to end up being a tuple. It's better to keep it in an some related object until you need to raw tuple.; That way you can have it throw exceptions when you want do :

a, b = item.var1, item.var2  if it tries to unpack a None or wrong object you can catch that exception to prevent an error.; Yeah I have lots of shitty experience with importing terrible pandas csv; csv with variable header location, first few rows with 1,2 columns and the header being at row 10, but row 11 has len(row_10) &lt; len(row_11) and you only want the data that's in that extra row.; Because the developer didn't think naming that column was important."
761,"i gave up on giving up, got rid of the orm stuff… made a list of tuples and insert ignored them; dont need to update because the url to the file wont change even if the file does"
762,"but, it works, its good, thanks for the advise <@Johana>"
761,Can you remind  me about the question/.
761,"Awesome, thaks for that, gonna look into it, sound definitely better what i used :stuck_out_tongue: <@Glinda> :taco:; yeah I used it for a choicefield that was created through a django widget"
761,hello I have a question
763,go ahead and just ask <@Claudine>

764,"Hello all. This is the very first time, I am trying something like this in Python. I need help. 
I am writing a script that reads from a csv file and gets only the headers and then I need to insert those headers into a table on SQL, but how do I define the datatypes ?
I can only read the header names from csv and not the datatype of each column."
764,Are you using a python database orm?; why do you need to define data type?
764,"I am trying to create ddl statement which would like create a new table on the sql using the columns I extracted from csv.; How would I define the datatypes for those columns then ?; CREATE TABLE TABLE (
COLUMN_NAME DATATYPE(SIZE));; As per that definition, I would like to define the datatype and size."
764,"So if you are reading in csv, you are reading in a string.; you can represent other items (int, float, string, char, bool, etc) using strings.; So you need a way of parsing in these values and giving the corresponding string the correct type.; Can you give an example of a few columns in the header and what you know the data type of each to be?"
764,"Yea, so will I have to parse them manually, or are their any methods that are built in that would help me do it ?"
764,it really depends on what you have; If one row of data =
764,Let me share the script I have written.
764,"`True, 1.01, 2, hi, h`; That will be slightly easier; What you have written is doing it correctly; csv datatype = varchar; or string; csv is storing your data as a string; can you paste an example of your header/ dattype"
764,Sure.
764,"If this is a one time thing where you'll never read in this data again, you can make adictionary with the headerstring, in this dictionary you'll have 'head_string':'data_type' then you use that relate to your database entry.; If you do it very often with the same heads, then you can do the same as first option.; If the heads are different and you need to inspect the actual data this is where it gets complicated."
765,I apparently dont understand how python logging works
764,I try to set the logging level to `DEBUG`
765,"but debug statements still dont print; Here is an MCVE:
```
import logging
  
mylogger = logging.getLogger('myapp')

mylogger.warn('warn1')
mylogger.debug('debug1')

mylogger.setLevel('DEBUG')

mylogger.warn('warn2')
mylogger.debug('debug2')
```; which prints:
```
warn1
warn2
```; no debug2"
765,You need to call `logging.basicConfig()` first to ensure some handler is set to format it
765,wow; thats super dumb
765,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import logging
&gt;&gt;&gt; logging.basicConfig()
&gt;&gt;&gt; logger = logging.getLogger('foo')
&gt;&gt;&gt; logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
&gt;&gt;&gt; logger.debug('foobar')
DEBUG:foo:foobar
```"
765,yep. So weird that you have to call it for anything to work.; would expect that to be default
765,"<https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig>
&gt; Does basic configuration for the logging system by creating a StreamHandler with a default Formatter and adding it to the root logger. The functions debug(), info(), warning(), error() and critical() will call basicConfig() automatically if no handlers are defined for the root logger."
765,well.. I thought I was crazy for the longest time
765,"Haha, yeah - python logging could use an overhaul; e.g. make it pythonic for a start"
765,"idea for a 3rd party package?; a pythonic, sane, logger?; that uses `.format` syntax"
765,"I'd rather ship apps :smile: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; but it isn't a bad idea, one thing it should include is a better way to do MDC logging"
765,"I mean, it could just read the stack"
765,"<@Signe> <@Beula> I recall reading an article about <https://github.com/jd/daiquiri>
It set up a modern logging configuration so you don't have to"
766,"Found it:
<https://julien.danjou.info/blog/python-logging-easy-with-daiquiri>"
765,"Looks like it has some niceties, color by default to a terminal is nice; Why did they do the same `getLogger` thing :disappointed:"
766,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
765,"I worked with a guy who spend a huge amount of time writing his own logger.; really smart guy, but it was a huge waste of time"

769,"<@Fabiola> thanks; <@Rosalind> you divide it in 3 parts: the _yielding_ part is the first `Word` , then you have the _loop_ `for Word in WORD_TOKENS` and lastly, you have the _condition_ `if not Word in STOP_WORDS`"

772,"and <@Shirl>, what’s the difference between windows output and mac?; `just looks different or something` isn’t too detailed"
772,"sry lads trying to wrap this into code but slack aint working with me today :stuck_out_tongue:; no on mac it doesnt really work; Ok, the while loop got print func that tests how good it performs, on mac it prints once and then nothing, the opencv ""window"" is very laggy"
772,"you need to use backticks, you are currently using quotes :wink:"
772,Here is the source btw : <https://pythonprogramming.net/open-cv-basics-python-plays-gta-v/?completed=/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/>
772,you didn’t have any problems installing opencv on mac?

772,"smart; ok, without any error output, not much we can do here; do `cvtColor` and `Canny` raise any exceptions that you can catch?"
773,Looking for help resolving 502 error hosting flask app on VPS. App works fine locally. Followed instructions: <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/flask-nginx-uwsgi-ubuntu-tutorial> . 502 on going to the domain and logs don't seem to say anything :neutral_face:
773,"so if you ssh to the server, can you see that your python application is listening?"
773,it's running as a service somewhere; i'm not that experienced with uwsgi/nginx
773,"or for example as they say in the guide, trying to go to port 5000, is it up?"
773,`lsof -i :&lt;port&gt;` if you are looking for a port; Or just `curl localhost:5000` to make sure your app is listening
773,5k doesn't work; i think the app crash(es)
773,is it logging anything?
773,"What if you try to run the commands manually, acting like the `.service` file?"
773,it sits waiting for confiuration; `[uWSGI] getting INI configuration from foobar.ini`
773,"So you are saying that your application itself is running, and it is `uWSGI` that isn't? If you aren't sure, start at the application, then step to uwsgi"
773,how can i verify if it's running? curling just gives connection refused; i don't know how uwsgi/nginx run the application
773,"You need to find the port your app should be listening on and try to reach it, are you sure you are trying the right port?"
773,"they talk about sockets instead of ports, does this matter?"
773,Or specific to the guide you are following - did you get the “Hello There” (or whatever your app’s equivalent is before the section “Create the WSGI Entry Point”
773,"yeah; sorry for late response, had to ddouble check that"
773,"so you can reach it on the port  directly, outside of uwsgi then?"
773,"yeah, both of the 'tests' work; `uwsgi --socket....` and `python foo.py`; afterwards `curl localhost:5000`"
773,what’s in your ini file?
773,same as in the link
773,and the wsgi.py is in the same folder?
773,yes
773,are the paths in the .service file all correct?
773,"i actually had earlier an typo there which i fixed, don't know if this matters though; double checking now; yup, all correct"
773,and when running `sudo systemctl start myproject` you see no errors?
773,jup
773,Any errors printed in the syslog (`journalctl`)?
773,"`$ journalctl
No journal files were found.
-- No entries --`"
773,"how does your `/etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject` look - is the socket file correct?  if you copy the path, can you see it?"
773,yup
773,and when doing `grep server_name /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/* -RiI` you see your server listed?
773,yup
773,and I’m guessing running the syntax error test returns no errors?; and running `sudo systemctl restart nginx` returns no errors?
773,both no errors; umm now it's saying it's running
773,it should be properly setup then.
773,`   Active: active (running) since Fri 2017-09-08 17:47:49 EEST; 15min ago`
773,like you can connect to the site through your main ip from the internet?
773,cant connect; can i verify if i am blocking it somehow?
773,what do the permissions/ownership of the sock file look like?
773,i might be using some firewall or similar but i cant seem to remember what setup i have; `srw-rw----`
773,"no if you are getting the gateway error it’s connecting to nginx on your machine, it’s something about nginx routing to the uwsgi socket; who owns it?"
773,my username and www-data
773,"and your username is the one in here:
```

Description=uWSGI instance to serve myproject
After=network.target

[Service]
User=sammy

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```; like, instead of “sammy” it’s “msorja” or whatever it is"
773,yes; exactly
773,what happens if in your ini file you change `chmod-socket = 664` and restart it?
773,which command for restart?
773,`sudo systemctl restart myproject`
773,no difference
773,what are the permissions on that socket file now?
773,`srw-rw-r--`
773,"hmm, in your service file, maybe try `ExecStart=/home/blizzard/myproject/myprojectenv/bin/uwsgi --ini myapp.ini --uid sammy --gid www-data`; basically add your username to `--uid` and the `--gid www-data` - and you did add your user to the www-data group right?"
773,"yea, but when i write `groups` it doesn't print out the `www-data` group ¿"
773,"okay, screw all this.  lets just make it run on a port.  lol"
773,:smile:; i hate uwsgi + nginx + python combo... i spent last time over 3 days (almost straight) getting it to work
773,"in the ini file, change `socket = myproject.sock` to `socket = 127.0.0.1:5000`"
773,just quickly - could you explain briefly the difference between sock and port?
773,"the port is just like you use connecting via the internet, sockets is a way for interprocess communication locally; in your nginx config, change `uwsgi_pass unix:/home/sammy/myproject/myproject.sock;` to `uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:5000;`; now restart :allthethings:; first `sudo systemctl start myproject`; then `sudo systemctl restart nginx`"
773,shouldnt i stop in between?; myproject
773,"oh, oops, yeah.  stop, or just restart should work"
773,still 502 :smile:
773,"yeah, I have no idea then, sorry.  I do know we’ve seen other people come in with issues specifically around that tutorial"
773,"yeah; vps configuration not cool; especially when it's my first and haven't reinitialized it in like 5 years... a lot of old configuration there, even some might be overlapping"
773,"yeah, this is why I love Docker.  :stuck_out_tongue:"
773,"yeah, that's where im getting next, asap I get to reinitialize my vps, but I think that's a big job too; but hey, thanks a lot , i'm out for today :unicorn_face:"

776,"question on a debate i'm having. we have a bunch of API classes that all take the same `api_session` parameter. we're debating these two approaches to a factory-esque thing:
```
from someapi1 import Api1
from someapi2 import Api2

def get_api1(api_session):
    return api1(api_session)

def get_api1(api_session):
	return api2(api_session)
```
vs.:
```
from someapi1 import Api1
from someapi2 import Api2

def get_api(api_session, api_name):
    return return globals()[api_name](api_session)
```; benefits of the first approach: don't have to remember the API names and intellisense-type completion works in IDEs; benefits of the second: all you have to add is an import, no getters"
776,why would you want a function that only init a class ?
776,"<@Ciera> so we don't have to import the APIs all individually, we can just import one ""importer"" and tell it what we want and it will find it; this is actually used in a fixture for pytest, so we avoid having to make a fixture for every API, just 1 one fixture that can import them all"
776,I don't know a lot pytest but if you really need it I would say the first one. I'm not a fan of using `globals`
776,"me neither, and i hate breaking code completion; argument against me is ""no one should rely on code completion"" :confused:"
776,or make an `if` statement for each `api_name`
776,"I am kind of with <@Ciera> though i don't love either, myself. In a rare case I have just had a function to init those kinds of things and auto discover them; but that complexity is isolated elsewhere"
776,"```
def get_api(api_session, api):
  return api(api_session)
```; I would prefer something like that (doesn't really provide anything here but we could imagine there is other param; but then you still need to import the api modules where you call the function"
776,yeah the problem is `api` is what there are a lot of
776,Or a dict of mappings
776,yeah a big if or a dict would be the best imo
776,example? not sure i follow
776,"+1 - it's clearer and more explicit; ```
APIS = {
  'v1': ApiV1,
  'v2': ApiV2,
}

def get_api(name):
    return APIS[name]
```; This is all a bit abstract, so it still feels a little awkward - is this for flask?"
776,"i gotcha, yeah that seems just a different version of #2"

776,"It probably does, what is the `api` classes?; You can use type-hinting if you are on new python :smile:; `apiv1: ApiV1 = get_api('v1')`"
776,<@Beula> `api` classes hold the methods for that particular API

776,yes let me push this there
776,"<@Beula> it allows us to be able to instantiate all APIs from one place, which for testing is nice; otherwise we need a fixture for every single API"

781,<@Sean> weird to have ssl on 80 not sure if that's working with nginx

781,<@Beula>  can you please help me understand? I am a newbie to python
781,<@Ciera> can i comment it out somehow? it was working with a static page
781,and I think you need to use `proxy_pass` and not `uwsgi_pass`
781,"&gt; The backslash (\) character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character; From <https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html>"
781,it might be working fine like this. It's just that usually 80 is for http and 443 for https
781,"oh, i wanted everything to be https, i found this from some tutorial"
781,"When you are working with backslash on print, you have to put a second one print('/\\  /\\')"
781,then it's better to just redirect http to https :slightly_smiling_face:
781,"The short of it is: certain characters have special meanings when escaped and they are escaped with a backslash, so to print a literal backslash you need `print('/\\/\\')`"
781,can you try that; and is the port 5000 or 5001 ?
781,"5k1 if i run manually now; oh yeah, something new, `Job for nginx.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See ""systemctl status nginx.service"" and ""journalctl -xe"" for details.` when i try to restart nginx `sudo systemctl restart nginx`"

781,"-&gt; 502 coming if not running manually
 -&gt; 502 coming if running manually; `No journal files were found.`"
781,can you do `tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log` or for your nginx error file; and when running manually you made sure to change the port in the nginx config ?
781,yup; <@Ciera> `invalid url prefix...` with your configuration
781,`proxy_pass <http://127.0.0.1:5000;>`
781,"doesn't work; as in prolem 502 persists :s; it's weird, because connecting to the port &lt;ip&gt;:5001 works"
781,is there something in the nginx log ?
781,nothing
781,are you connecting with the ip or the domain name ?; and if it's domain name is the dns correct ?
781,"trying both; correct dns; the situtation is, i am using the same vps and nginx configuration to serve static files for different dns"
781,`less /var/log/nginx/access.log` something in this ?
781,i;m using cloudflare as the middleman (now I for this have toggled the middleman part off); let me see
781,so you have a working nginx on the vps for other domain ?
781,yes; but they're serving static index.html file(s); `sudo netstat -peanut` doesn't even show usage of the port 5k; should i try to go back to the sock usage?
781,if the curl to the port work it should be fine
781,what do you mean
781,you said connecting to the port works ?
781,"yes, if i run it manually; should i keep it running manually? is what i meant; _is there a big difference between socks and ports?_"
781,yeah keep it running manually for now :slightly_smiling_face:
781,i got it working o_O
781,no not a big difference; sockets are usually a bit faster I believe
781,"i got it working using sock somehow, but there's no ssl now"
781,to have ssl you need nginx to listen on 80 and redirect to 433 and listen on 433; you can do that like this
781,"is there a default config for this?; thank you, let me try it out"
781,obviously you need to adapt a bit :slightly_smiling_face:
781,"yeah; okay, cool, progressing. now i get ""Your connection is not private"" error from Chrome, and if I enable cloudflare I receive 502"

I'm trying to run this condition `int(np.sign(weights.T.dot(points))) != y` however I've been getting this error for a while and can't seem to debug. I'm new to Python and Numpy. Here's the error: `ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.`

Code: <https://gist.github.com/hallaksec/99ab4d6a6da93ed9ff991a5e3315a291>"
786,"Probably best to break it down into individual steps so that you can see from the error line number exactly where the problem lies. e.g.:
```
dot = weights.T.dot(points)
sign = np.sign(dot)
int_sign = int(sign)
if int_sign != y:
    # etc
```"
786,<@Gabriele> I can tell that its `np.sign(weights.T.dot(points))`
786,"but is it the np.sign call, or the weights.T.dot call?"
786,"Its the .dot; Here's a sample:
```weights = [[ 0.  0.  0.]]
points =  [(array([ 1.        , -0.18592399, -0.14921323]), 1), (array([ 1.        ,  0.63754454,  0.36669891]), 1)]
```"
786,is it expected that the elements in points are arrays?  how was that constructed?  do you know the expected dimensions?
786,"<@Junita> i constructed points using this function:
```def generate_data(self, N):        
        print(""[+] Generating Data.."")
        data = []
        for i in range(N):
            x, y = [np.random.uniform(-1, 1) for i in range(2)]
            points = np.array([1,x,y])
            data.append((points, int(np.sign(self.V.T.dot(points)))))
        return data```"
786,so points is the return value of `generate_data`?
786,Yup; Full code here <https://gist.github.com/hallaksec/99ab4d6a6da93ed9ff991a5e3315a291>
786,"so, take this with a grain of salt as I’m a numpy noob myself - but I think the issue here is that you are trying to use a multidimensional array here instead of a numpy matrix"
786,"If I replace np.array with np.matrix `shapes (3,) and (1,3) not aligned: 3 (dim 0) != 1 (dim 0)`; So I guess my vector V is now the problem but I replaced the np.array with np.matrix as well which yields `only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`"
786,"so, you can give a shape to `np.random.uniform`; although I’m not 100% following what you are trying to do - but yeah, I think trying to construct it the way you are is at fault; also, I seem to recall a tip of avoiding rank 1 arrays like that, where it’s better to use a vector (i.e. something of shape (n, 1) vs (n,)"
786,Can't seem to find any solution :confused: <@Junita> <@Gabriele>

792,thanks im looking thru it
792,"using the `csv` module you can iterate over a `Reader` object which is a generator, so you won't load it all into memory; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader>"
792,what is a good way to measure/test whether or not its properly running (e.g. using or not using a bunch of memory)
792,"Yep, +1 for the csv.reader:

```
import csv

with open('massive_file.txt') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    headers = next(reader)
    for row in reader:
        pass
```; you can do `free -m` on a posix machine (linux, mac)"
792,If your machine didn't crash then it's probably fine :grimacing: 
792,lol id like to not crash my computer :slightly_smiling_face:
792,it shouldn't since you only have a row at a time
792,Are you familiar with the concept of generators in python? 
792,kind of - I havent really used them much yet tbh -i would likely use them for csvs but  i usually throw all my massive csv into gocsv
792,"Or more accurately, an iterator ; Well, the whole concept of an iterator object is that it doesn't hold the data structure in memory, but iterates over the elements per requests, yielding the relevant part ; In case of the csv module, that means that only one line is read into memory each time, and released when the next one is called "
792,thats exactly what I want
792,Hence the recommendation :wink: 
792,thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
792,"I think `panda` had some nice tools for handling csv, but 8 have no experience with that "
792,"playing around with the suggestions now - will be back shortly lol; yeah i saw a few answers on so about pandas; but i dont use it much, ive found other workaround sometimes suit better at times"
792,It may be overkill for your needs though ; <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html>; Can you share the code you used? 
792,"```def readCsv(filename):

792,"Well you kinda misused the csv module there. You don't need to implement the iterator yourself, reader is already an iterator ; I'm on the phone so forgive the crude syntax :
"
792,oh its fine - i just kind of mashed 2 different functions together lol - open to suggestions/etc that I can fix; I have one that I usually use the csv with haha so I was trying to add the part of that which I like
792,Well for off you can use `DictReader`that will return a nice dict object per row ; Ah gotcha 
792,basically i want it to write to file in real time - so i can preview results as it is building if needed (which I do a lot); thats the only requirement really for me
792,Not sure what you mean by real time... 
792,im prob mixing two concepts together - i imagine thats whats wrong here lol
792,"Maybe. Well I'm off for now, night "
793,I have a problem when trying to use .update on a dict from a json file; It seems to disregard the dict from the json file and replace it with the dict I want to append
793,<@Kati> use the `+` button to add a code snippet with the code you're having an issue with
793,"It's a bit messy after all the experimenting, but I'll make a clean example and upload it, 2 sec"
793,"<@Kati> I get back:
```In [14]: a = Example()
{u'posted': {'new_value': {}}}```; which is the expected behaviour; are you expecting something different?"
793,"I want it to append the new value to the already existing dict from the json file; like this 
```{
  ""posted"": {
    ""112asdfasdfas833434000714_207568954"": {},
    ""new_value"": {}
  }
}
```"
793,"ahh; so `update` is not a deep update, it only does one level of keys, so that entire `posted` key is getting updated with the one from your new json; if you want to update a key inside the dict, just call update on that key's dict; `get_json_dict['posted'].update(my_sec_dict['posted'])`"
793,Aha! It's that simple; Haha had me stuck for hours
793,cool! glad i could help :slightly_smiling_face:

794,hi; i’m having trouble in finding out what encryption this is; BAGfxzupdBepIrhfNxeDoQ==; could someone help me?
794,<@Niki> could be anything. Can you provide more details?
794,of course. It is supposed to be an encrypted e-mail

794,"i mean, is like a encrypted e-mail address; <mailto:foobar@gmail.com|foobar@gmail.com> for example"

794,that is what i want to find out; i dont need to know the original string
794,You can't. It doesn't work like that.
794,"i need to know if it is md5, base64, sha256.."
794,These aren't encryption algorithms. These are hashing algorithms.
794,"ok; so, is there how to discover which hashing algorightm?"
794,"Only by hand. You should learn about all these algorithms, how they form a hash and why base64 is actually not a hashing algorithm; I can tell that it looks like a base64-encoded string, although the decoding doesn't give me anything remotely useful"
794,"ok. I will do that; but it is definitely not md5, right?"
794,"Yes. md5 is a hex string, it cannot contain letters except for a-f"

     ['Sheet D', 'Location 4', 'Upright']]```; Paste up is triggered with the following.; ```paste_up(data_sets[52])```; Am I missing something simple <@Ciera>?"
811,"your first `for` loop goes through `X` and  `0` you should make a seconde one to iterate through the entries; `sheet, location, axis = entry[1]` Here you just take the first entry but you should loop to use them all"
811,"If I try any others I just get this.; ```    sheet, location, axis = entry[23]
IndexError: list index out of range```"
810,yeah that's because `X` and `0` only have 4 elements. So you get an index error when trying to access the 23th
810,"Alrighty, but how does one get the variable from the command to copy over to the function?; ```paste_up(data_sets[0]) - 0 Being the variable```; I've tried a few different things like *params.; ```def paste_up(*params):```"
812,I do not get what you are trying to say :disappointed:
813,"I'd like a bit of advice. I'm using imagehash to help me find similar images. I have 20,000 to hash, so it's pretty slow. Would either threading, asyncnio, or multiprocessing speed up this process? I've never really used any of these before."
813,<@Amalia> assuming you are just generating a db of hashes than yes they will definitely help as you can hash them independently
813,and then use the db for lookups
813,any particular one you would recommend?
813,"but if you're iterating over the images each time, expect it to take a while"
813,All the above could help although I'd recommend asyncio as that is most up to date one and definitely worth learning
813,"<@Amalia> are you planning to iterate over the image set each time, or are you storing the hashes for later lookup comparisons?"
813,i think just a one time iterate
813,If you iterate like that then yes it will take a very long time
813,"just to be clear, iterate once and then save the results for later lookup"
813,"Ok, with the async model you'll iterate once to add all the hashing tasks to the pool and then wait for them to finish before doing the later lookup; Adding to the pool is basically instantaneous. It's the waiting for all the tasks to finish that will take some time"
813,"thank you. I assume this still only uses 1 core. As there is no waiting for responses, such as for across the internet, is using aync much quicker?"
813,"not really; if you're using multiple cores, then yes; but as far as using one core, you may have to use threading to help out with that.  Not sure if asyncio does that implicitly; you may want to ask in <#C07G5276F|async> about that"

814,"Hey What's up guys ! I have a question regarding testing that's been on my mind lately and I was hoping you could enlighten me. So here goes: How do you effectively test a function that makes a call to a website and returns a response object ? Like in the case of a web scraper for example ? (code sample below); ```
import requests
def make_soup(url):
     response = requests.get(url)
     soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text)

make_soup(""<http://google.co.uk>"")
```; Is it relevant to want to assert that make_soup called `requests.get` with the correct url ? or should I pass requests as a dependency ?; Not really sure how to tackle this; thanks in advance !"
814,to make sure `request.get` is called with the correct `url` you should mock request for this test
814,I think this package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-mock> may help
814,I use the excellent responses library for mocking requests: <https://github.com/getsentry/responses>
815,"I haven't used the library recommended by <@Luana> so I can't compare, but the key thing is to mock one way or another. Without mocking, you're not testing your code so much as testing the API / website itself. It makes your tests fragile and slow to run, as network problems will make your tests fail etc."
814,Nice !! thank you very much <@Fabiola> <@Luana> <@Ciera> !; I suppose the same approach would apply to DB insertions ?
814,definitely
814,"I prefer `pook` myself, no need to specifically mock any lib but it mocks the network layer; <https://pook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>; You can basically:

```
@pook.get('<https://myurl>')
def test_my_url():
    my_lib_function()
    assert pook.isdone()
```; It has a load of matchers you can use with it"
814,Are people writing separate functional tests for the APIs at all?
814,"Doesn't that typically depend if the API provides you a ""sandbox"" or demo env?"
814,You tell me. :slightly_smiling_face:  This is not an area I work in much. The APIs I use are public ones and I've not encountered that sort of functionality.
814,"Generally speaking, I don't if I don't have a testing env for them due to rate limits and such; I mock all the major response cases so I know if I can handle the error conditions around their API - generally speaking most places are decent about not breaking existing APIs; Assuming their devs are decent, anyway"
814,The people I'm working on this with have made some functional tests. I don't know if it's necessary: <https://github.com/keboola/sapi-python-client/tree/master/tests>
814,"One of the APIs I use is the Nominatim endpoint... it's barely documented and the source code is spaghetti PHP, so I have little confidence in it :smile:"
814,"oh, that's a fun one to use; especially when the rate limiting doc says 'depends'; with no hard limits"
814,"yup. Unfortunately I refuse to use Google Maps/Places, and Factual are discontinuing their Javascript API in favour of an app that semi-secretly tracks their users, so my options for a public places database are very limited"
816,what about mapbox?
814,"they are very committed to open source, and were very prominent at FOSS4G last month; with the main dev for Leaflet, Vlad, giving three talks"
814,Doesn't look like they have a places database
814,"oh, thought you meant geocoding"
817,Mapzen? <https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/> Also seem to be big proponents of oss
817,"Looks like it has potential. If only their docs weren't written by a frustrated English Literature graduate; I mean, I'm trying to browse it to find out what it actually offers, and I come across a page detailing the Chicken response format: <https://mapzen.com/documentation/wof/formats/#chicken>"
817,every api should have chicken format
817,I'll add it to my backlog
818,"hey guys, I've been thinking about whether I should use a Mixin or Class Composition. In my scenario, I have a cross cutting concern that I would like to share across a few classes. For concreteness, lets say the class looks like the following: 
```
class CrossCuttingMixin(object):

    def initialize(self, service, external_id):
        pass

    def is_enabled(self, payload):
        pass

    def is_id_allowed(self, id):
        pass
```
1. Is it better to write a mixin or use class composition (i.e. initialize the class within another class)
2. Should mixins should keep state or be stateless?
3. Any good reads on this debate?"
817,"Your example is a bit too abstract for me to understand what exactly it would be used for, but these days it's common to prefer composition to inheritance, certainly; It's not like Python makes it easy to enforce the interfaces anyway"
817,"<@Gabriele> check out abc, you can enforce interfaces (e.g. when trying to instantiate a class from an ABC, abstract base class, you'll get an error if any abstract methods are not overridden)"
817,Starts to feel a bit like Java then :wink:
817,<@Gabriele> - what about testability? Classes become harder to test because of composition; The only way I could think of making it easier is passing the class as a param on initialization
817,"Why? Mixins are just composition that the compiler does for you.; I guess you can't easily pass several different composed types to the same tests, but if you really want the same interface across them, you can add that"
817,"Mixins aren't composition; You can write them as such, but it's still a  ""is-a"" relationship there"
817,"Composition is more about aggregating functionality than about interfaces; Well, I'm thinking on a more abstract level. It's still just taking the bits from one thing and inserting them into another. Is-A and Has-A becomes rather fluid in a dynamically typed language anyway"
817,"Not really, inheritance is always ""is-a""; Dynamic doesn't really impact that at all"
817,"But you can have ""is-a"" without inheritance, and you can have mixins with all 'private' members which don't really give you any sort of useful 'is-a' relationship.; As I see it, the only really important thing is, ""does this object support this interface?"""
817,"It's not about whether or not you get anything useful from it though; And you are right, that _can_ happen; But that's digressing from mixin not really being composition"
817,I still think it's just a matter of perspective.
817,Far enough :slightly_smiling_face:
817,"For Python specifically, I'd define the difference between Mixin and Composition classes in this way:
```
#Mixin
class Mixin(object):
    def do_something(self):
        print 'Hi'

class BaseClass(Mixin):
    def run(self):
        self.do_something()

#Composition
class Composition(object):
    def do_something(self):
        print 'Hi'

class BaseClass(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.composition = Composition()

    def run(self):
        self.composition.do_something()
```"
817,Sure
817,"<@Gabriele> Is right, a mixin is meant as a type of composition, it really depends on how the mixin class is written"
819,"say, we have a Deep Learning model written in python2.x and the next step is to deploy it as a web service. Is it okay, if the Flask REST APIs are in Python3.x; How do me maintain the parity?"
817,<@Tameika> Are the Deep Learning models populating a database or something? Or are you wanting to trigger the py2 models from the flask app?
819,"True, they should all trigger py2 models as well libraries installed for py2.x"

819,"honestly, that's what I interpreted your original question as"
819,<@Meg>  <https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/remote_gpio.html>; the only problem is when i follow it line  by line i´m still missing some files
819,<@Cherrie> How does it not fix the problem? You need to load the config from the environment if you can't store it in settings.py
819,"<@Beula> is there a way to leverage another settings file?; like a ""databases"" only setting file"
819,eg `dev_settings.py`
819,sure
819,"Sure, set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='other.settings.file'`; And in that other file extend your base; <https://github.com/pyslackers/website/tree/master/config/settings>; That is how we do it for this community's website; But we also use the environment"
819,"I tried to move the second db connection to the dev_settings.py, but it seems to overwrite the test_settings which means my tests try to run using a real connection as opposed to a test connection.  I suppose the real conflict is between test_settings and original settings and where to put the second database connection"
819,"I guess I am not following you, take a peek at the link above - we have three different settings files (dev/test/prod) that all extend a _base; each adds its customization"
819,"<@Beula> sure, for your example, when you run your project you're selecting which settings module to run via the command line, right?"
819,"We override the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` envvar: the manage.py sets the default to ""development"", testing uses pytest-django (which sets it to testing), and in prod we set the envvar explicitly"
819,"oh got it, my settings are just misconfigured; thanks <@Beula>"

823,can someone help me with python for AWS lambda? I have a simple question
823,"<@Charlena> ask away, someone will see it and answer you if they can"
823,<@Charlena> I've been playing with it a bit lately.
823,How do I access a variable from one method to another? lets say I have a variable goals=5  in my method goal_total()  . How do I access that goal variable in another method? I've tried a few things but for no success. Also i wasnt able to find proper documentation on that topic.
824,"Can't you just set global variable at the top of your file?

```
GOALS = 5

def goal_total():
    # something to do with goals
```; You can also set Environment variables pretty easily which is handy"
823,<@Charlena> I have just started playing with AWS and lambda myself - I would have thought what <@Lorna> said - is that not working?
823,"<@Charlena> there's no state sharing between lambda executions, you need to use an external store for state"
824,"that can be things like external databases (postgres, etc.), key-value stores (dynamodb, etc.), or if they're direct deps, invoking other lambda functions directly either via API gateway or SQS"
823,<@Charlena> so you want data to persist between Lambda calls?
823,"<@Lorna> no I'm not that deep and into stuff like persistence yet. But I made a simple lambda function and the normal python way seems to be working.; def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # TODO implement
    
    
    print (hello())
    print (""hi"")
    
    
    
    return 'Hello from Lambda'
    
    
    
    
    
def hello():
    
    a=""5""
    
    return a"
823,<@Charlena> you can use the little `+` button on the left there &lt;-- to add a python snippet
823,I was able to print 5 when I called hello(); <@Marcie> will do next time. Thanks

825,"Sorry, what?; Whatever gave you that output is broken - that string is a `repr` of a python dictionary; You shouldn't exchange `repr`s of python objects and try to deserialize them; you should serialize objects in a sane manner (for example, using `json.dumps`) and exchange that instead"

If at all possible, this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate environment).

825,<@Eustolia> ok wait. i see
825,"<@Ciera> I've digged cpython hg repo in order to find the fact that this documentation section was added _before_ introducing `pickle` module... but I failed. Apparently `pickle` has been added in cpython v1.2, and there were no such section in the docs at the time.; I think this is a bug in the docs - nobody should ever try to recreate an object using its `repr`"
825,<@Collette> :taco: for the research; Yeah I wouldn't do it either. I was also quite surprise when I saw that in the doc
825,which part of that doesn’t seem to be working?; oh.  oops.  slack fail.  that was in response to something that was apparently said forever ago.  weird
825,<@Ciera> that section was added between v1.3 and v1.5.2 - I can't be more specific because for some reason v1.3 &lt; cpython &lt; v1.5.2 has reference documentation in ms doc format instead of LaTeX :smile:

826,I'm not entirely sure I understand what you are trying to do; but it all looks unpythonic to me; so there should be a way to optimize that :slightly_smiling_face:
826,"Ok, I can try to explain what I'm aiming for"
827,Hey guys. I've been working with Django and I want to learn more pure Python. Any simple projects in mind?
826,"the function returns a checksum of all captured numbers, using XOR"
826,the best is to find something useful for you. Maybe some thing you do everyday that you can automate ?
826,"I'm looking for a more efficient way to capture the values I want. 

Currently generating a list, then trimming the list down one element at a time, really slows it down at larger values"
826,Yea that was what I was thinking but I don't know the limitations of what Python can do. For example one project idea I had in mind was creating an auto deploy system for my job but I'm not sure if Python is able to move files through ftp
826,"all captured number being 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,12 ?"
826,"yes, all elements from the first line, then 1 element less, per line"
826,"&gt;  I don't know the limitations of what Python can do
Python can do everything :wink:"
826,As so I hear. Do you personally know how to go about that? I just need help with that part and I think I'll be good
826,There’s a module for FTP: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html>; tools like fabric are useful though for automating tasks like that

826,other lengths follow the same pattern as well

830,maybe I focused too much on cramming a bunch of stuff on that one line
830,can you explain what are x and y ?
830,"x,y: is taking the first two different values generated from the iterator; which it then turns into one value; then when another is generated, it reduces that, compared with the previous value"
830,ok got it; are you sure this is the way to calculate it ?
830,"to be honest there might be easier ways; I didn't even know about XOR binary before this problem, like I understand the concept, but this method is what I came up with by putting a couple stackoverflow answers together; so it's possible the delay is taking place there"
830,I'm not at all familiar with this stuff so idk
830,"but I couldn't find an easier way to do xor on two ints than by doing that; sure, no worries; it's a weird problem, I have 24 hours left to solve it"

(i) Show all Categories on the same screen 
(ii) When a user clicks on one of the Category bars, show all of the subcategories on the same screen
(iii) When a user clicks on one of the subcategories bars, show the tags under the subcategory.

We are using google charts for this right now but it is painfully slow. How would anyone here go about this?

831,"Thanks. I’m solving this question without using additional Tree Node data structure. It says that the question can be solved with in place traversal of the input matrix using BST property of tree, so I’m trying that.

````
Find the least common ancestor between two nodes on a binary search tree.

The least common ancestor is the farthest node from the root that is an ancestor

of both nodes. For example, the root is a common ancestor of all nodes on the

tree, but if both nodes are descendents of the root's left child, then that left

child might be the lowest common ancestor. You can assume that both nodes are in

the tree, and the tree itself adheres to all BST properties. The function

definition should look like question4(T, r, n1, n2), where Tis the tree

represented as a matrix, where the index of the list is equal to the integer

stored in that node and a 1 represents a child node, r is a non-negative integer

representing the root, and n1 and n2 are non-negative integers representing the

two nodes in no particular order. For example, one test case might be ...

question4([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],

           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

833,"Hi! 
I've stated using SQLAlchemy in my new project and can not exactly get the relationships part.
I have a method which goes over a list of `Candidate` objects, its model has ` applications = relationship('Application', backref='candidate', )` and in that loop I want to merge the Candidate objects to different session. Problem is that it only merges the `Candidates` not the `Application` objects to the other session.

843,you are storing it as a string?; are you using an ORM or SQL directly?
843,no timezone :open_mouth:
843,im adding it with 'datetime.now()'
843,"that looks like `%b. %-d, %Y, %-I:%-M %p` as the format, except the `%b` locale abbreviated name for September is `Sep` and not `Sept`"
843,"So once the job has been accepted i run this 
`def accepted_date(self, resale):
    resale.accepted_date = datetime.now()`

now is it easier to format the date/time before it gets sent to the db? and how?"
843,"`.utcnow()` would be preferred instead of `.now()`. And if your DB driver is DBAPI compatible, it will convert datetime's into the correct format for your DB"
843,okay thanks :0; :slightly_smiling_face: *; Why does this give me an error obj.accepted_date.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')#; 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strftime'
844,It's telling you that `accepted_date` is None
845,are you returning the `resale` object from your function before trying to persist it ?
843,"I have no idea. The job is created then accepted at that point 

`
`; `def accepted_date(self, job):
    job.accepted_date = datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")`"
843,fyi it's backticks ` :slightly_smiling_face:
843,"that runs and inputs the date it was accepted. but it still is shown like `Sept. 14, 2017, 9:19 a.m.`; Okay, can i start again please.

So my aim is to compare the accepted date field with today date and calculate the number of days that have passed.

So when a job is accepted, the date/time is inserted using this statement
`def accepted_date(self, job):
    job.accepted_date = datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")`

In the admin i am trying to calculate and show the number of days.

`
    def get_accepted_date(self, obj):
        date_format = ""%m/%d/%Y""
        today = datetime.date.today()
        today = today.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')
        accepted_date = obj.accepted_date

        #diff = accepted_date - today.strftime('We are the %d, %b %Y')
        return obj.accepted_date
    get_accepted_date.short_description = 'Accepted date'
    get_accepted_date.change_date = ''
`

This is what i have so far. but i cant get the formats to match so i can run `diff = accepted_date - today`"
843,"`today.strftime` creates a string, then you try to subtract that from accepted_date, which won't work; You'll need parentheses around the subtraction operation - or better still, to calculate that first, then call strftime on the result"
843,"Okay i have removed strftime from the functions that upload the date when its accepted; and tried it again and it is still showing the same format, Sept. 14, 2017, 9:30 a.m."
843,"what shows that, and why is that a problem? You're interested in calculating the days that passed, so I don't see how the format is applicable"
843,"Its showing like that in the admin models, how do i got from that format to calculating it with the format of todays date :confused: ahh my head hurts"
843,"the text format doesn't matter; the difference between dates is based on the value stored in the date, not the way it displays it on screen"
843,"ah okay, so its just a case of comparing them"
843,"yes. for some reason it looks like you insert a date as text, which is a bad idea, but even so, you can convert it back to a date, then perform the subtraction normally; dates need to be stored and compared as datetime objects. Leave the stringifying part to the very last minute, when you're displaying the info"

843,for code blocks use triple backticks with no spaces on either side of the code block
843,`unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'datetime.datetime' and 'datetime.date'`

is giving me `can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`"
843,"and then your diff you're returning, if all you want is the number of days difference, you can `return diff.days`; ah, then change the `.utcnow()` to `.now()`"
843,"ugh, Python UTC handling is a bit broken, unfortunately. I'd suggest using utcnow everywhere, if you can"

843,"yeah, ^ agree with that. in general UTC should be preferred for storage. if you need to render date/times in a locale specific TZ, that should be done on the presentation layer; `accepted_date = obj.accepted_date.replace(tzinfo=None)` to remove the TZ Info"
843,thanks for this btw guys
843,I believe that both .now() and .utcnow() are offset-naive in Python (even though that is clearly incorrect for UTC). You will need to make sure that obj.accepted_date created in the same way

848,I think I would create a class method for `Reseller` and `Customer`; something like `Reseller.get_unique(id_)` that check into a dict if the id exist
849,how can i get only package that i use one project
849,<@Georgetta> What do you mean?
850,quick question. How do you convert a string to a date and then substract dates from each other; so 2/2/17 - 2/7/17 will give me 5 days
850,"<@Felicita> Don't convert it to a string to do any sort of math, you do that with the datetime/date struct; Convert it to string just for presentation"
850,"timedelta and datetime.strptime(‘Jun 1 2005  1:33PM’, ‘%b %d %Y %I:%M%p’); i think he’s going from string to datetime obj"
850,"Oh woops I had it backwards, you're right"
850,i’ve provided some tips. try those out and come back with what you have tried :wink:.
850,"<@Mallie> <@Johana> Yea I needed to convert it to date because I'm getting the date from the front end as strings; <@Johana> yup will give it a shot thanks; end_date = datetime.strptime(‘Jun 1 2005  1:33PM’, ‘%b %d %Y %I:%M%p’)
                                    ^
SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier; Are there supposed to be spaces?"
850,you may need to adjust your import statement of datetime.; `from datetime import datetime`; something like that
850,"Invalid character in identifier... did you copy and paste that line, perhaps?"
850,actually you don’t need timedelta either. i have some code here where i compare dates. i’m not formatting from a string but it shows the general idea: <https://github.com/openstax/research-p3-experiment-4/blob/master/digital_logic/experiment/service.py#L298-L311>
850,yea I imported it <@Johana>; <@Gabriele> yea I copied it straight. But then I tried typing it
850,"The error just looks like maybe you copied a character that doesn't work in Python, that's all"
850,"yea, i got an error on the quotes.; i’ll adjust it"
850,"<@Johana> Are those date types?; <@Gabriele> Yea probably, let me try type it manually"
850,it’s the quotes for some reason they are jacked up.
850,just your right it was the quotes just as I finished typing it out too lol <@Johana>
850,and yes those are datetimes.; sqlalchemy takes the datetime field from the database and converts it to a python datetime obj.
850,the dates actually subtract without any conversions. I just need to convert the result into a readable date now
851,"i just discovered groupby from itertools, how can someone know about these functions if they are not usually covered in courses?"
851,what led you to finding it?
851,there are some books out there that try to cover the standard lib.; i think there is one called standard lib by example or something like that.; reading source code from many projects helps you learn those things too.
851,the standard lib is _huge_ so it's really hard to cover the whole thing

853,"Hello! I'd love some help with a mock.patch issue I am having. I am using Django/DRF to run some integration tests. My test is using the http client to make a request to the DRF API. I use service classes inside my API viewset functions to do the bulk of the logic, e.g. I might have a test method that uses `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService', autospec=True)` to mock the UserService class used by the API and this works great. What I am unable to do however is mock the `SMSService` that the `UserService` uses internally. I cannot come up with a `mock.patch` target string that mocks that class. I've tried `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService.SMSService', autospec=True)` but of course `UserService` is a class not a module. I've also tried `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService.login.SMSService', autospec=True)` to target a class function but that also is not doing it. Is this possible - I want the `UserService` code to run during my test but not the `SMSService`.; OK, so actually I was able to do this with a direct patch to `mock.patch('core.services.user_service.SMSService', autospec=True)`"

value = type(mgr).__enter__(mgr)

858,"Hi everyone, any stripe experts in here?"
858,i know a bit; whats up?
858,"Sorry, just noticed your response, I'm also in the Stripe IRC chat lol; I think I've got it worked out, I'm just trying to figure out how to tie up the loose ends in my payment system. I'm not sure if there are things I should be keeping in my database that I'm not"
858,"ah ok; yea, that just really depends on how you are using it, the stripe IRC can probably help you a lot more"
858,"yeah I'm talking to a guy in there right now. He seems to think what I've got now is good enough. I mean, it works, I'm just nervous about releasing it to the wild because, you know, it's peoples' credit cards lol; I'm afraid I'm gonna zig where I should have zagged and accidentally charge all my customers $1000 LOL"
858,"yea, you for sure dont want to store credit cards; stripe can tokenize payment methods, thats probably what you want to use if you can"
858,"oh I am, I'm way past that point lol; I'm not worried about releasing credit card info, it's never touching my servers. I'm only concerned I'm not using stripe properly and am going to accidentally double bill someone, provide a refund wrong, or something along those lines; or not handle an error properly and Charge a customer without giving them access to stuff via my database, etc; just trying to consider all the possible ways this could go wrong, haha"
858,"ah gotcha, thats more your app code then… just gotta test it over and over and over and make sure you only call things when they need to be called"
858,"yeah; it's my app code and also my DB design; I just feel like I should be keeping some sort of a history in my database in terms of charges, invoices, etc; currently I'm not, and it works fine, but I feel like there might be a time down the road when this design will shaft me lol"
858,"yea, you should keep track of transactions; who paid what when; or who was paid what when; depending on the direction of money flow; there are many ways to do that too… basically, it’s a log of what you need or want to track… with any log, the more information you log, the better, because who knows when you need xyz"
858,true true!; I mean it's logged within Stripe
858,"but its still a log, so dont stress about it, you should at minimum track the who was paid what when stuff; yea, you should keep your own log too though"
858,"But the reason I ask is when customers change plans the easiest way for me to do it was to have them cancel their current subscription and sign up for a different one, rather than use the stripe upgrade/downgrade stuff and deal with changing billing cycles etc"
858,"maybe your system things someone got paid, and stripe doesnt show a refund… this is why you also need a log"
858,"so when I do that and delete the customer to start fresh it wipes their billing history.; ok, cool; I will probably create a payment history table for each user then"
858,"ah, you should for sure use stripes (or your own) upgrade/downgrade; dont let users cancel then signup again; you will likely lose people that way"
858,"well, then I will need to undo everything I just did, lol"
858,"lol; i mean, its your app.. so you can do what you want"
858,"It takes about 2 seconds to switch though, I couldn't see people really having an issue with that"
858,just doesnt sound like the best UX; im no expert though; so yea haha; do you have a subscriptions table?; could you not just ‘on upgrade’ switch the users subscription_id to whatever they changed to; then in transactions log you can also store what subscription they were on at the time of the transaction
858,Yeah I could do that. I might ... this was just the fastest/easiest way I could think to get it working
858,for sure
859,"hey guys, is this a good way to sum properties of objects contained in two different arrays?

```
expenses = [Expense(""pizza"", 50), Expense(""Rock Concert"", 100)]
incomes = [Income(""Salary"", 5000), Income(""Dividends"", 200)]

total = (
    reduce(add, map(lambda income: income.amount, incomes)) -
    reduce(add, map(lambda expense: expense.amount, expenses))
)
```"
860,```sum(income.amount for income in incomes) - sum(expense.amount for expense in expenses)``` ?
858,"traditionally, this is done by having one list of transactions, and the expenses having a negative value, this way you can just sum one list, it also makes several other common operations much simpler"

862,"Got a question about `threading.Thread` (_I'm fairly new to working with threads &amp; am not 100% sure about what's going on behind the scenes_) .

I'm generating some live MIDI signals, and found that if I use `thread.start(); thread.join();`, the thread becomes blocking and I lose realtime functionality.
Alternatively, if I only use `thead.start()`, without `thread.join()`, the realtime functionality acts as expected.

Are there any potential issues with starting a thread and never joining it?
Is joining an optional thing for when you _want_ a thread to be blocking, or is its usage required in some way?"
862,"<@Libby> I have not used the `threading` module much but I can't see anything in the doc to imply that `thread.join()` is is anyway a necessary operation. The thread terminates when `run()` returns, you shouldn't have to do more than ensure there isn't an infinite loop somewhere in there to ""clean up"" the thread part of things. You definitely shouldn't _have_ to force another thread to wait for it with `join()`."
863,"I have a maybe dumb question about the sortedcontainers package. is there a performance advantage to using sortedlist versus a regular python list and sorting after each insertion? as i understand it, sorting is a solved problem at O(nlogn) so whatever sortedlist does to maintain sorting at all times cant be any faster then the standardlib sorting function, right?"
864,"It can be.; If you insert and then sort, you're doing `n * n * logn` which is `n^2`; if you insert something into already sorted container, you kind of already know which position it will occupy (maybe not with 100% certainty)"
864,"if you just append to the list then sort its 1 + n * logn, right?"
863,whats the performance of binary search using bisection? i think thats what sortedcontainers library uses
864,"if you append every time it's N append+sort operations, and with sort itself being n*logn it becomes n^2"
864,"oh right; bisect is logn so, if you use it to maintain the sort then its n * logn, right?"
864,:thinking_face:
864,"```bisect.insort_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))¶
Insert x in a in sorted order. This is equivalent to a.insert(bisect.bisect_left(a, x, lo, hi), x) assuming that a is already sorted. Keep in mind that the O(log n) search is dominated by the slow O(n) insertion step.```"
864,"Not sure if this library does this, but one trick about sorted containers is that they don't actually need to be sorted at all times or after every insert. They only have to be sorted when you try to read from them; So they can postpone the sorts, unless they're trying to provide strong guarantees about each operation"
864,thats a good point; but the SortedContainers package maintains the order at all times; <http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/introduction.html>
864,best just benchmark it
864,good call. i’ll do that now
864,"It looks like it uses something like a heap of indices. Personally I'd be surprised if this sort of package made a positive difference to performance, with the extra memory and complexity involved."
864,i saw it mentioned on a lot of stackoverflow questions about sorted datastructures so i figured it was considered the standard
864,probably is. :slightly_smiling_face:

865,"Out of interest, might heapq be a contender here?"

866,<@Tatum> would that be substantially faster?
866,I can’t tell because I’m not sure of the running time on the bisect algorithm; but using a tree would be O(log n) per element addition; which is super fast
866,<@Tatum> well sortedlist is marketed as a pure Python solution

866,"Hmm. I have an avl tree I wrote for a project.

You only need access to the min or max value of the list. For fun I'll timeit as well"
866,"Actually no; a tree in python turns out to be slower; I think this is due to the class instantiation overhead; ```

871,"<@Junita> This is the response from the query ```[OrderedDict([('capital', '376031.95'), ('product', 'CORE_PRODUCT')]), OrderedDict([('capital', '15000.00'), ('product', 'NEST_EGG')])]```, Now this user has both the products core_product as well as nest_egg.; ```so it will be capital.data[0][""product""] == ""CORE_PRODUCT""``` and ``` capital.data[1][""product""] == ""NEST_EGG""```"
871,I guess I’m not understanding the problem then.   What do you mean by “make it deterministic” - do you feel like it’s non-deterministic now?  Do you get different values on different runs?
871,now these two variables   `core_capital` and `nest_capital` should have the value of the respective products if the user has them in his portfolio or it should be 0.
871,have you tried something like `for item in capital.data:` and then replacing instances of `capital.data[0]` with `item`?
871,"No, i will try that"
871,and accumulate the results
871,"```        for item in capital.data:
            if item[""product""] == ""CORE_PRODUCT"":
                core_capital = item[""capital""]
            elif item[""product""] == ""NEST_EGG"":
                nest_capital = item[""capital""]```; <@Junita> Thanks for pointing me towards the right direction.; Was i being too stupid ?"
871,"np.  and no, not at all.  it just takes experience.  and now you have more than you did before.  :slightly_smiling_face:"

875,"Hi Everyone, looking for a bit of advice on where to being reading, libraries to look at maybe some examples if there is one.  I have a list of 180,000 items I need matching images for, so want to download images from a google search, rename the image to the search string, create a 100x100 thumbnail, upload the original and thumbnail image to an s3 bucket and add the new file name to the original csv file.  I am really new to python so apologies if this has been asked before."
875,"that is a _really_ ambitious scale; because if you’re running it on your own machine for 100 items, it could take about two seconds per item to execute; that’s about two minutes there to test"
875,"Ahhh ok, time does not really matter, I can sit and leave the machine running int he background."
875,"and assume you’re able to get it down to a half second per item when deployed, that’s still 25 hours of execution time; and if you’re still on the two second/item average, that’s basically four days"
875,which means you’ll definitely want to be able to track your progress locally so you don’t have to rerun it from scratch when it inevitably fails partway through for some reason.  :slightly_smiling_face:
875,yup
875,MAybe batch it down to 1000s at a time; not a problem if it takes 2 weeks
875,do you have any kind of programming experience?
875,I know python on a basic level and have experience in javascript
875,"well a couple things there - google often has apis you can interface with directly instead of trying to scrape a page.  I’d look into that to see if that’s possible; it’ll also help because they’ll eventually shut you off otherwise; otherwise, I’d just sort of sketch out your approach on a piece of paper and get to building the individual pieces in isolation, as it’ll make the whole thing feel a lot more manageable"
875,<@Junita> the image search api is deprecated though
875,thats what I thought I had read <@Meg>

875,(I feel ethics-bound to mention that this application is probably strongly against copyright law)
875,"ah, is it?  is there not a replacement?"
875,"use custom search instead, which apparently is an umbrella replacement"
875,<@Gabriele> you can usually specify licensing in the search
875,<https://developers.google.com/custom-search/>
875,<@Meg> thanks for that
875,"It might be possible to get results with a legit licence, yeah"
875,"I have no idea if that will be possible through the custom search though, it is through the UI"
875,"any particular libraries I should look at? I know Boto will handle the upload to S3 and urllib will grab the images from the search, what can I use to resize the image  / create the thumb?"
875,I’d use `requests` in place of urlib; and use `Pillow` for the image manipulation
875,Ok thanks for that
875,"if you want speed, you can use imagemagick and call it via subprocess; huh, apparently imagemagick has python bindings; <https://wiki.python.org/moin/ImageMagick>; or wand; <http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.4/>"
875,"Cool, thanks for those <@Meg>"
875,<https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor> &lt;- that's much faster than shelling out to imagemagick
876,Oooh thats interesting thanks <@Carri>
875,The feature of image detection algorithms look really helpful
875,"although if you were to use Pillow, and are running on a machine that supports SIMD instructions I'd recommend this drop-in replacement that's substantially faster than vanilla Pillow <https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd>; &gt; Pillow-SIMD with AVX2 is always 16 to 40 times faster than ImageMagick and outperforms Skia, the high-speed graphics library used in Chromium."
875,isn’t smid integrated in almost all CPUs post Pentium 3?
877,"but dang, nice find! <@Carri> :taco:"
875,"yeah, in some forms. although it has evolved to SSE4 these days, and AVX support from 2011"
875,"Anyone know how it's possible to run a function in a class through a subclass with multiprocessing?
So I have a `class tracker` which I'm calling with a subclass called `class Track(tracker)`. 

I then have a list containing many subclasses: `Track`, I would like to call a function and give the same input ""an image"" to each subclass `Track` by using multiprocessing. 
Currently it is working using: 
```
for i in range(len(listOfTracks)):
    listOfTracks[i].update(image)
```

And then i can extract the information from each Track using a call to `pos = listOfTracks[i].get_position` 

When I'm trying to add multiprocessing to it, I never receive the updated position, but I can see the image I input is different, but it seems like it's not saving or updating as before, since the `Tracks.get_position` call always return the same position. 
```
procs = []
for i in range(len(tracker)):
     p = mp.Process(target=tracker[i].renew, args=(img,))
     procs.append(p)
     p.start()

879,My SO question on `celerybeat` got an upvote after 7 months! There is still hope :astonished: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42322486/celery-beat-schedule-schedule-to-run-on-load-then-on-interval>; If anyone knows the answer in here that'd be awesome.
880,Why not schedule a task on startup?; your project will have a main.py or something right?; <@Mallie>
880,"<@Vada> Because it is a longer running task and I don't want it to overlap, nor preferably would I have to track state for objects updated (which is an option). Right now I want it to run hourly and it finishes within 30 minutes, but I don't want it to run over itself. Scheduling a task on startup would just mean enqueuing it when the service starts? That would be esp. troublesome in the way I stated because I need to restart the celery services when I deploy code (it is a production Django project). I have hooks to reset the service so it'd be great if the functionality existed so I could just delete the right file or run the right command to run the task on startup but not have the interval locked again to always run 1 hour from when it was originally scheduled.; As it is now it is easily worked around by not updating code related to the task during the interval (:00 - :30) every hour, and if the code isn't related, just restarting the services. So it is managed by controlling releases.; But if I did have to make a critical code update to the task, I wish I could just force it to reset after purging the queue."
880,I see two options; 1) You have a check (e.g. a cache lock or anything else) which the task checks - if the lock is active the task dies; 2) The task calls itself on finish - scheduling the next run that way; neither would use beat; I think beat is wrong for this if you want to schedule it from after it runs on startup; and definitely wrong if it cannot run concurrently
880,"So (2) is interesting - is there a way to do that in celery? I wasn't aware. Like, I could see the end of the task and say `run again in n minutes`? That'd be fine, I thought `celerybeat` was the only option for scheduling"
880,"I've not done it myself, but considering python supports recursion, you should be able to just call the task again"
880,or call an api endpoint for which generates a new task
880,"e.g.

```
@task
def this_task():
    # do stuff
    this_task.delay()
```"
880,"you could also do something at the end of your run like

```
    task = SomeTask()
    task.apply_async(args = args, queue = 'queue')
```"
880,<@Meg> that means you need another task to call that endpoint to trigger the task though :wink:
880,not always
880,"So I didn't realize
```eta (datetime) – Absolute time and date of when the task should be executed. May not be specified if countdown is also supplied.```
existed, nor `countdown` for that matter"
880,have a view handler; and post to said URL
880,"yep although  if the only reason you are doing it every hour is so it doesn't overlap, you may as well just do the countdown"
880,Yeah just saw that too hah; I thought the only options were `do now` or `celerybeat` so that's cool
880,<@Meg> but why would that be better than the task calling itself?
880,<@Vada> :taco:
880,"I mean that is the task calling itself, but via an API endpoint right?; ty <@Mallie>"
880,If this Slack existed when I first was working with celery would've been great lol
880,"ah, never mind"
880,Instead of my 7 mo issue and SO question
880,I was thinking recursion depth; and trying to avoid bottoming out
880,Haha I can post an SO response as well if you want
880,"so when a task calls itself, does it get put in the broker?; or does it immediately execute on the same worker"
880,"yeah delay doesn't actually call the task, it posts it to the message broker"
880,"gotcha; ah, then `run` would execute immediately on the worker"
880,so it should become a separate stack - although I'd be very interested/surprised if that isn't the case
880,"FWIW, I prefer `apply_async` vs `delay`"
880,They're essentially the same thing righht?
880,"because it lets me specify the args, queue and any potential tasks to run after sequence; `delay` is a simplified `apply_async` with non-overrideable defaults"
880,"yeah that's true; I default to delay, but use all of them in some places."
880,"So another question, and this may get more into broker specifics, but does anyone know how celery/RabbitMQ would handle scheduling *a lot* of tasks (30k+)? Right now I update a large number of objects via `requests`, so I just queue them up in order once an hour - that was really the only good option with using `celerybeat`, but with what I just learned, it would be conceivable to set a timeout 60 min from the run time for _each_ object at the startup. Approximately 60 min is/will be sufficient for these objects to update, so the container task to just enqueue them (unscheduled) at the same time has been fine and i wouldn't make things more complicated without a reason. Just wondering how it might handle it if I had an interest in doing it differently in the future, e.g. I wanted objects to update at a different rate. So a few parts:

1) Would it have any issue with retaining an `eta` or `timeout` for a lot of tasks (let's just say 100k)
2) Is there a simple way to inspect if a task is currently scheduled?"
880,"for 2; you mean personally, or by a program?"
880,"Programmatically, b/c it would basically be `if this object task not scheduled scheduled, schedule this object task` because I would need to run the checker on some interval since objects may be added by users; Then, have the object task schedule its next run when it is done, and so on; I'm not sure if I could do that without tracking state"
880,"so for 1, no it won't have an issue - but you may have a bottleneck in terms of your numbers of workers.; so regardless of ETA; if there aren't enough workers to get the job done, it'll take a while"
880,"Well now enqueing them all at once only takes about 30 minutes with current config, so I have an external job to check the stats to make sure it doesn't need to be tweaked and so on. Spreading them out would be perfectly acceptable, it was just unmanageable with `celerybeat` obv."
880,for 2) You can check what tasks are in the queue and inspect the workers (e.g. <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html?highlight=revoke#inspecting-workers>)
880,Ah sick
880,One of the things we have in house is an RSS feed processor which can't be run concurrently; celery has a cookbook for this; <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/task-cookbook.html#ensuring-a-task-is-only-executed-one-at-a-time>; specific to django; so that is worth looking at as well
880,Great great <@Vada> :taco:; el dubble taco
880,:slightly_smiling_face:
880,"That'll be great to consider later if I have an interest in tweaking things for users that may warrant more frequent updates and so on so very cool; The thing I query actually may chance every second, but the 60 minutes is an acceptable ""free"" aggregate update; So that'd be cool to be able to tweak it per-object; And I just added `memcached` a few weeks ago; Also, up to you if you want to nab the question <@Vada>, I think the alternatives you have raised are a good solution; So I'd accept it and you could get them sweet SO duckets"
880,I mean in an ideal world you'd schedule a task every time it updates as a post-commit hook
880,"Well our deployment isn't based on a repo action - it is rolled into a single command but it requires someone (me) to tell it to release; But if I were to leave `celerybeat` and just make sure each object schedules itself out at end run, if there is a necessary change it would still affect them all after a release so should be fine; Every release I just restart `celerybeat` and `celeryd` in case related code changes - I have never experienced issues there"
880,Post db commit :wink:; not git commit
880,oh ha
880,but I can see how that misled you
880,I was a bit confused as to how that'd work lol
880,:stuck_out_tongue:; It would be quite amusing if commiting code affected prod in that way; but not a good idea
880,"""Our software is so agile we couldn't stop it if we wanted to""; Well sheesh after my experience on SO and talking within other groups I was thinking no one used celery; So this has been great"
880,I use it quite a bit; and i think <@Patty> made a few PRs to the project

880,Joining this Slack has already paid for itself :money_mouth_face:
880,but is sadly completely underfunded
880,"<@Vada> I got that impression, which is unfortunate because is there _any_ alternative in Python?"
880,"there are a few, but none so complete"
881,why do i need to restart server (python manage.py runserver) for my admin data changes to appear on the site
881,<@Domonique> we have a very active <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel which is the best place to ask django q's :wink:

880,"so, I use celery alot, and the previous dev rolled his own system using zeromq and other bits and pieces; it was a pretty fragile async task network, tbh; celery is _much_ more robust and featured"

      },
```; the app i’m pulling from is a bit dated so this may have changed syntactically."
880,require and imports :slightly_smiling_face:
880,"Ok, is it absolutely necessary to have a js file for the scss import? Or is there a way to set that up in the webpack.config.js?"
880,it’s webpack that will see the import and extract the css for you.; as it builds your project.; my style above also uses the sass way guide. <http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project>
880,Mine does as well. I'll setup a js file to import the scss and see how that goes.
880,in your plugin you are already specifying what you want the output to be.; `new ExtractTextPlugin('./website/static/css/bundle.css')`; you can even include hashes and shas if you want for caching.
884,"Got it working. I still don't see why there cant be a way to roughly do the following

```
module.exports = {
    scss-entry : ""./path/to/style.scss"",
    scss-output : ""./path/to/style.css"",
    use : [{""sass-2-css"" : {source-map : True}}, ""autoprefixer""]
    ...
}
```"
880,'roughly ' as in very roughly
880,"Yea, when I've done that in the past webpack would make extra js files. I can try it layer."

891,"What is `correlation_tracker`? Is that safe for use across multiple processes?; And when you say you can't extract the position, what actually happens instead?"
891,"<@Gabriele> correlation_tracker is from the dlib library <http://dlib.net/imaging.html#correlation_tracker>. I'm not sure if its safe, but I suppose since I initialise several instances of it, that each instance should be able to run in multiple processes ? (I might be wrong here)
About extracting the position, I can execute the command but I don't get an updated position from the tracker, it stays the same value as when I initialised it."
891,"It's hard to make assumptions about 3rd party software although I'd hope that each process would be sufficiently isolated. What is the actual result variable you're watching here, or the function you expect to do the work? I don't know dlib."
890,"I have an image with some detections on (bounding boxes marking each person). 
I'm initialising a subclass of correlation_tracker which I called Tracker for each detection. 

Next image I'm calling each subclasses.update function with the new image and then the function updates the tracker to a new position depending on the image input (it searches nearby its old position) and it gives a confidence score in how well it did it as an output. 

Then I call the subclass.get_position() which should return the trackers position, but this position stays static (with the same numbers as when I initialised it with the `[tracker[i].start(img, rectangle(*rect)) for i, rect in enumerate(points)]` call."
891,"not sure if you can follow me; I have a list with objects where I'm trying to call each objects update function and this is where I would like to do it in multiple processes, so each object can update parallel and be done ~the same time, instead of after each other."
891,"Okay. It's still a bit confusing to follow, partly because you have commented out code in there which doesn't look like it would ever do the right thing, such as each tracker creating its own Pool, or calling amap which doesn't seem to be a documented function; I'd recommend maybe writing a similar test case where you replace the dlib stuff with a dummy function of your own choosing, and verify whether that works correctly or not. If not, the problem is elsewhere in your code"
891,"The pool thing is some old code from old experiments with it. I get your idea and will try it out and see if I can get anything to work. 
Thanks for your time!"

```
from types import SimpleNamespace as SN

```
When I try to use dict() or json.dumps() I get a TypeError.
Is there any pythonic way to cast it to dict other than manually iterating over attrs and converting them to dict?"
892,"you can create a custom encoder:
```
class CustomEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):

How do I get this to work?
```
karee = {'K3 compressors': 'a a a',
         'K4 compressors': ['bbb', 'c cc', 'dd d']}

for k,v in karee.items():
    tag_list = list(v)

```

It prints the first one as 
```
a

a

a
```

I want it as 
```a a a```"
897,"Instead of `list(v)`, you probably want `v.split(' ')`, or similar"
897,"I don't want to split the strings, I want to print them as is"
897,"It doesn't help that you have a different data type for K3 and K4... that is going to be awkward; okay, so you want a list with just 1 item in it?; (It should probably be a list in the original data)"
897,"```
karee = {'K3 compressors': 'aaa',
         'K4 compressors': ['bbb', 'ccc', 'ddd']}
```
is also an option


I want to create a function that adds items together.  If there is only one, it should just add that one.
I'm using strings, as I will use those strings to refer to pandas dataframe columns; the strings i put there are just random nonsense now. They can contain any amount and combination of characters"
897,"Well, ideally you'd _always_ have lists as the values, so it's unfortunate your data looks like this. But if you can't change that, you'll probably have to inspect the type; e.g. `tag_list = v if isinstance(v, list) else [v]`"
897,"ahh. I'll try that, thanks; It works. Thanks"
898,"Hey Everyone ! I got sort of a newbie question related to imports; I've got the following directory structure for my project; ```
├── app.py
├── db.py
├── exceptions.py
├── helpers.py
├── __init__.py
├── requirements.txt
├── tests
│   ├── db_connection.py
│   ├── db_operations.py
│   ├── http_requests.py
│   └── __init__.py
```; what I would like to do is this: from within `tests/db_connection` I want to import db from the top level directory; only problem is when I run `python -m unittest discover` I get an `ImportError` saying that there's no module called `pokemon_scraper.db`; (the project folder is named pokemon_scraper); I have put init.py files inside both directories; not sure what I'm missing; thanks in advance for your precious help :slightly_smiling_face:"
898,where do you run that command from?
898,from the top level directory; where requirements file is located
898,"Hmm, I don't know then. I find Python very awkward for this sort of thing. Often I have to hack in edits to sys.path to get my tests to run.; An expert probably has a better solution though, so hopefully they'll see this"
898,yeah it's a very strange behaviour; thanks for your input <@Gabriele>!
899,"what happens if you try to import from db directly?  I think a lot of the test runners (I’ve never used unittest discover myself, so just speaking generally here) add the root folder to your search path; when you try and import from `pokemon_scraper` you are trying to import from the directory above that; I usually also contain my code within a `src` directory, or something like that, to help keep things tidy, and then import in my tests from `src`"
898,yup it was an issue with the unittest package; I switched to nose and now it works fine
899,"cool.  I *think* nose is on the outs though, right?  I still use it all over the place because I’m old and stubborn, but is it still under active development?; I think the kids these days are using pytest or something similar?"
898,:fidget_spinners: pytest :fidget_spinners: only :fidget_spinners:; I'm a kid-these-days
898,haha
898,I switched to pytest myself. But I run it from Pycharm so I've no idea how it works outside of there
898,"what does pytest do that nose doesn’t?  I feel like I asked this question, got a satisfactory answer, but I’ve forgotten.  :stuck_out_tongue:; I suppose one valid answer is “get actively developed”  :stuck_out_tongue:"
898,"`assert`, fixtures, plugins, parametrized fixtures and test cases, test functions instead of classes...; lots of things, actually; They have only one thing in common: they're both test runners."
898,"it has some magic fixture stuff, which looks pretty but which I dislike because of the magicness. But I'm sure it can make for quick test development"
898,"&gt; dislike because of the magicness; yeah, I hate python, where is my `malloc()` :stuck_out_tongue:"
898,Not really the same thing; In this case I'm talking about decorators that magically rewrite things to inject arguments
898,"^ that's my biggest concern, too."
898,"why magically? they just rewrite things, not magically"
898,I'd rather want to explicitly request fixtures to use in test functions
898,"All sufficiently advanced technology looks like magic. This is advanced and mostly hidden, so I call it magic; ""explicit is better than implicit"", right?"
898,"implicit is implicit, not magic :confused:"
898,"i.e. ```
@pytest.use_fixtures('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
def test_stuff(foo, bar, baz):
    assert foo == bar == baz
```"
898,<@Collette> you can do this :))
898,Link?
898,<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html#usefixtures>
898,It's not the same.
898,"I guess of that list, plugins could be nice"
898,"in older pytest versions this was the only way, but now you can do it implicitly too
I remember the older tests I've written when there was no fixture injection."
898,the others I seem to be getting away with on my own just fine.  I mean it’s not like I don’t have fixtures.
898,"In my example I can actually _use_ fixture objects in the test function, while `@usefixtures` is just, well, ""enabling"" fixtures for that test function"
898,"and you could always test functions instead of classes, right?"
898,"<@Junita> what? `nose` is a runner for `unittest.TestCase` cases, you can't write a dedicated test function and expect `nose` to discover it"
898,"<@Collette> I don't really understand the distinction. In older pytest versions `usefixtures` is the only way to access a fixture in a test function. The result is the same.; Without it you can't do it, with it you can. :confused:"
898,"&gt; Within a test module, functions and classes whose names match testMatch and TestCase subclasses with any name will be loaded and executed as tests
<https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>; I mean, I’ve done it, the docs say it, so you definitely can"
898,"hmm, i guess information in my head is outdated then; but you can't define `setUp`/`tearDown` for these test functions, right?"
898,"yeah maybe at some point in the past you couldn’t, it’s possible; To my knowledge, no.  If I’m going to do `setUp` and `tearDown` I’m going to just use a class"
898,"Right; From my experience, I pretty much always need fixtures/setUp :slightly_smiling_face:; The only exception is test functions in which I test whatever is in a fixture/setUp method"
898,<@Collette> can you explain how they are different? it's totally lost on me :confused:
898,'they'?
898,"&gt; In my example I can actually _use_ fixture objects in the test function, while `@usefixtures` is just, well, ""enabling"" fixtures for that test function; I think I'm missing something, but the behaviour seems identical to me"
898,"I was thinking about the case when ```
@pytest.mark.usefixtures('foo')
def test_foo(foo):
    pass
```
passes, but ```
def test_foo(foo):
    pass
```
fails with `TypeError` about missing arguments; I also dislike that whole `pytest.mark` idea. It's so highly dynamic that introspection doesn't work"
898,"&gt; fails with `TypeError` about missing arguments
It was like that before they decided to make fixtures available by default, which is not really nice... I agree."
898,"Maybe given py3 annotations, we could at least do ```
def test_foo(foo: pytest.fixture)
```..."
898,"I wish some projects, especially that can hugely benefit from annotations, dropped py2"
898,django? :slightly_smiling_face:
898,"I have almost zero experience with Django, but if it's anything like Flask then lack of certain py3-only features doesn't really stand in the way too much.
But some flask extensions are py3-only and they use annotations to define endpoints which is really cool if you're designing an API"
898,On pycharm. Is there a way to see what method will be called when a class inherit from two classes with the same method and no super?
900,"not sure about pycharm, but in the debugger you can look at `__mro__`"
900,That's good enough <@Junita> :taco:
900,om nom nom
901,Anyone familiar with `async/await` ?; I was wondering if it's relevant to use this construct in the context of DB operations; say DB insertion for example
901,"It's likely to be an overcomplication unless you truly know that you need it, and even then there are other optimisations to try first"
901,yeah depends on how things are made.
901,what kind of other optimisations ? (out of curiosity)
901,Depends on the application
901,someone wrote an article a bit ago arguing that async for db isn't useful as they are so fast.
901,"Maybe you don't need an insert, maybe you can postpone it, maybe you can write to a cache, etc"
901,but if all your app is async you might as well use it
901,ah I see !
901,"<@Ciera> I expect you mean this one, by the author of SQLAlchemy - <http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/>"
901,The thing is I failed to find a concrete usage example for async/await
901,"I don't agree with all the conclusions, but broadly speaking it's right"
901,even for a simple http request to an external service
901,<@Gabriele> yes thanks :taco:
901,"If you have an application that needs to perform slow I/O operations as well as be responsive in some other way, then async operations may be what you need; e.g. I write video games, and I don't want to hang the whole game while we do a Quick Save, because we need to render every 16 or 32 milliseconds. So we do the save asynchronously"
901,<@Gwenda> you might want to read <@Signe> article <https://hackernoon.com/async-through-the-looking-glass-d69a0a88b661>
901,"This sort of thing doesn't come up in Python that often, I'd argue"
901,this one might be best to start <https://hackernoon.com/asynchronous-python-45df84b82434>
901,thanks a lot <@Ciera> :taco:
902,<@Gwenda> did you read it? Did you enjoy it? Did you learn anything?
902,<@Gwenda> <@Signe> ^^ is the one who wrote it :wink:
902,yup the first one; was particularly helpful in understanding how async vs sync works; I really liked the fast food vs bank analogy
902,awesome. Glad it helped
903,yea that was one of my fav. parts too. :wink:
904,"I want to make python service for simple server monitoring ( is it available by IP or not ), so I need to make constant requests, I once in a minute. What is the best way to do it?

905,"Oh that's nice, I don't use Atom"
905,I do find it’s useful to “Find All” first to make sure you are actually aware of what will be changed
905,Nice - i'll check that out. I can see where you could screw up a lot really fast but I figure if it's one line it'd be safe.; Thanks all.
905,"and apply the change one at a time; reviewing the section beforehand, with the filename; I screwed up spectacularly once upon a time; fortunately, `git revert` saved my bacon, and nobody knew"
905,"of course in the end, just make - ha yeah that; make sure you are doing it in git, and you have other changes committed"
905,the last part was the key point
905,<@Junita> Find in Project is super useful! :taco:
905,"actually looking at it, it may not do multiline replace, and doing a \n doesn’t seem to work"
905,because mixing that kind of changeset with existing changes is not cool
905,so maybe I owe you a taco back.  :stuck_out_tongue:
905,Haha hmmm...ya I always wondered if any IDEs out there did allow multi-line replace...cuz that seems useful.
905,<https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/issues/398>; could always code it up!  :stuck_out_tongue:
905,"<@Dominick> To some extent I'm sure they do, just depends on what you prefer. Emacs isn't an IDE persay (though you can customize it to one) but you can do multi-line replace. Visual Studio has an add-on for it I've never tested... For Atom though jkelly's issue tells you the status there."
905,"<@Mallie> Definitely. I've never used emacs or visual studio actually. Looks like it doesn't quite work in Atom, but Find in Project should suit my needs. More of an exploratory question at this point :slightly_smiling_face:"
905,"If you have a need for it that you think will take too much time in Atom, could always jump to something like `sed` that I mentioned to; Just depends on if learning the steps is faster at that time and such..."
905,"I'll explore that option. tbh, I don't have _that_ many to replace, I'm just being a lazy (or efficient, if you're being polite) programmer haha"

I want to do calculations in different python scripts, each using 'custom variable types' that I created using classes in another file.
It worked okay, but now I want to move those python scripts each into their own folder, because they all use two files as inputs and give one file as output. I want it organised into folders.

This is my folder layout
```
-----main folder
  |- module
  |   |- __init__.py
  |   |- custom_class.py
  |- script folder 1
  |   |- script1.py
  |   |- script_1_input.csv

  |- script folder 2
  |   |- script2.py
  |   |- script_2_input.csv
  |   |- script_2_output.csv
...
```; it keeps complaining about my module not having some attribute. As far as I know, I have created that attribute in my file as; ```
class PumpSystem:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.levels = []
#other functions down here

929,"Hi all. I came to know about the usage of filter along with lambda function in Python. Just like the the following 
```d = {'a': None, 'b': 'myname', 'c': 122}
print dict(filter(lambda x:x[1], d.items()))
{'b': 'myname', 'c': 122}```.  The result is `a` get popped. That’s what actually I need. Here I couldn’t figure out what does x:x[1] stands for. It would be great if someone explain me what is exactly happening. Thanks in advance."
929,"<@Cleotilde> lambda is pretty much the same as ```
def to_filter(x):
    return bool(x[1])
```"
929,Okay.
929,"The items method of dictionary (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=items#dict.items>) returns a list of tuples in the form of (key, value), the lambda function is called on each tuple, and the [1] notation refers to the second element in the tuple which is the value in the dictionary; so in this case if the value is falsy it gets filtered out"

930,"hello, I am trying to implement `pivot`, consider this scenario. Given a dataframe df with schema as `id, url, type, val`. I wish to convert it into a dataframe with schema as `id, url, type1, type2, type3, ...` where each column value in `type_i` is dervied from the `val`"
931,"anyone here with bulk indexing in solr experience?  I have a project coming up in which I have to index about 10 million web pages on S3 as well as an continual average of 20k or so per week.  Objects in the celery bucket are like `/bucket_name/$db_id/path/to/file.ext`

Distributor task - take in a folder ID and get all html files from the folder, recursively
Single-page index task - Responsible for indexing one single web page, started from parent task above

Using Celery, my workflow is like this:
1. Query db for IDs of records and chunk to distributor celery task
2. Celery task uses `boto3` to get all html files from the S3 `bucket_name/db_id` 'folder'  Puts path in queue for single-page index task
3. Individual page processes and inserts into mysql db table
4. Once all child tasks are finished, parent task triggers a Solr DataImportHandler API call to do a delta-import from the mysql table, which should import all the recently inserted data from mysql into solr
5. After import is complete, delete all imported rows from mysql table; I plan on using at least four distributor workers, and about 20 single page workers, so this can easily overwhelm the solr import API"

934,morning! anyone able to give me some advice on getting out of a while loop? python newbie here
934,use ```break```
934,not allowed for this homework assignment
934,"write some condition in while ,eg:; ```while count&lt;0```"
934,"maybe some context would help. the assignment is to recreate the game of “Pig”, human vs computer. player rolls a die, and can keep rolling as many times as they want, and then the other player rolls. first player to 50 wins.  if you roll a 6, your entire score for that round is 0. I’m work on the ask_yes_or_no method, which includes a prompt."
934,"```
a = True
while a:
  a = False
```"
934,"<@Chi> if you need to prompt, you can use something like `input(""Enter yes or no"")`"
934,"the code is doing the opposite of what I want it to do.; not sure if it’s appropriate to post the entire thing here (it’s 100 lines); this is the prompt function ```def ask_yes_or_no(prompt): 
     roll_again = True
     while roll_again:
          answer = input(prompt)
          if answer.startswith(""y"") or answer == ""yes"":
              roll_again = False #why does it run properly when roll_again = False and not True?
              
          elif answer.startswith(""n"") or answer == ""no"":
               break #not allowed, but not sure how else to get out of this
               
          else:
               print(""sorry, what was that?"")   
```; when it’s nested in the computer_move method, and i run the program, if I type “no” it loops back and rolls the die again. if i type “yes” it just keeps asking “roll again?”"
934,"so, a while loop looks at the variable sequence and evaluates it to true or false.; you only set `roll_again` once in the loop, and that's when the input is that of 'Yes, I want to roll again'; you should set `roll_again` to be True` in the `if` and `False` in the `elif` block"
934,"```def ask_yes_or_no(prompt): 
     roll_again = True
     while roll_again:
          answer = input(prompt)
          if answer.startswith(""y"") or answer == ""yes"":
              roll_again = True #why does it run properly when roll_again = False and not True?
              
          elif answer.startswith(""n"") or answer == ""no"":
              roll_again = False
               #break #not allowed, but not sure how else to get out of this
               
          else:
               print(""sorry, what was that?"")   ```; when i enter “yes”, it just endlessly keeps asking “roll again?” when i enter “no”, it rolls the die"
934,then the issue is whatever else is within the conditionals that you're not posting here; you can post a code snippet by pressing the + at the side of the text entry and selecting `Code or Text Snippet`
934,<@Chi> I feel like something is missing here
934,ok. this is the whole program so far
934,"so with `ask_yes_or_no`, you're not returning a value there to use within the `while computer:` loop; so you should modify the `ask_yes_or_no` conditionals to

```
if answer.startswith('y') or answer == 'yes':
    return True
elif answer.startswith('n') or answer == 'no':
    return False
else:
   print('Sorry?')
```; because a `return` inside a loop is an implicit break execution"
934,that doesn’t break the loop. it continues to roll the die
934,but I think you have your whole program structured wrong.
934,we have to use the functions provided. starter code of sorts
934,is this intro to programming?
934,yes. intro to python and java; thanks for your suggestions everyone. i’ll pick this back up when I get to work. have to catch the bus

Do you have any idea why? Already went to check the *$sort* operator page on MongoDB manual and although they say it works with two fields, I don't seem to be able to replicate the functionality.

&gt; ""This operation sorts the documents in the users collection, in descending order according by the age field and then in ascending order according to the value in the posts field.""  (<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sort/index.html#ascending-descending-sort>)

I’ve tried several different ways but can’t get a good google result. I must be fighting the framework?"
939,<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/urlresolvers/#reverse>; that's what you're looking for in place of the `url` tag in the template; since you would have to do this in the view

939,"I don't think citation is going to help, as by default images aren't published with a license; i.e. you straight up can't use them without talking to their author; (except ""fair use"")"

939,so it seems like you’re using past images to promote the event?
939,Yep!
939,"yep, can’t do that without the permission of the owners of the image"
939,Even from instagram? Ok i will make sure to ask just in case

950,"doesn't python cache the compile anyway; when you exit the python repl, do all objects go through their del methods?"

As per: <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html>"
950,"how do I ensure my program exits ""correctly"""
950,your OS will do a cleanup anyways
950,let me rephrase
950,@yea I got `returning` to work just playing with different things and I thought of that and was trying to find if there was a good way to do that. Mostly it was a question about joining tuples and ducks 
950,"I have a requests object which holds a connection

950,"<@Winnie> well, you can use a `with` statement to do a cleanup in case of an exception or what not
```

950,"so, got a celery question for the gurus here.  

Lets say you have a task that takes in an argument, and uses those args to do some processing and generate parameters for a large number of short-lived tasks to execute.

950,"```
import atexit
atexit.register(lambda: session.close()) # or something
session = requests.Session()

# 1. Ctrl+D

How do I get Task C to execute if and only if all of Task B created from the specific Task A have finished executing?"

950,Is there a polling mechanism in celery? 
950,chains/chords should get you there <@Meg>; <@Winnifred> celery is pub/sub
950,Ah okay 
950,"In order to speed up queries, is it common practice to mark a model instance with `True` or `False` if it passes an error check?"
950,"<@Meg> if you want to see some of the ones i’m using you can refer to this: <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/tasks/calcs.py>

these are the calculations done by biglearn. they are on a particular schedule and all they do is check an endpoint for calculations. if there are calculations it may run the calcs and save the results and continue recursively or they will calculate and post their results."
950,what does pub/sub mean
950,the environment biglearn has to work in is not very reliable so that is why it does checks for calcs. if there are no calcs it short circuits and tries again later.
950,"so my use case here is indexing many web pages on a S3 bucket.  The initial task gets called with the db ID of the S3 folder to be indexed.  Inside `run`, it gets a list of all `htm(l)` files with the db ID prefix.

956,"<@Winnie> Depends what you mean by “quadratic”, but I assume you mean O(n squared) where you expected O(n)

It goes slowly because of all the string-copying going on: strings are immutable, so the expression `', ' + name` effectively means 
“take a copy of `, `, then copy all of `name` after it”

And then `s += ', ' + name` means:
“take a copy of `s`, then copy the chars in `', '` after it, then copy `name` after that”

As `s` gets longer, it is being copied much more often than needed.
You’d be better off to use `join`, e.g.
```
s = ', '.join(names)
```"
956,"Yes, but it still takes a reasonably ""significant"" amount of time to compile, even when cached. 577ns just to emit the compiled re pattern from cache (752x faster than cold cache)
```%timeit r = re.compile(""((hello)+|(hi)+)"", re.I)
The slowest run took 752.60 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.

964,"<#C07EFMZ1N|help> *I'm looking for advice:* I've written a python3 script that when run, it texts me if I need an umbrella that day (utilizing twillo and the weather underground API). Is there a tool I can use to schedule this python3 script to be run every morning? Cron works, but only when I have a computer awake and set to run that script.... I'm new to this, and it's one of my first scripts so what are my other options? Any way I can set up this job in the Cloud for free?"
964,Aws as a free tier for a year that you can use 
965,And even after the free year the lambda cost would be cheap
964,Another option is throw it on a cheap computer like a raspberry pi that can always run for you :slightly_smiling_face:
965,"The lambda cost would actually probably be free after 12 mo, the free tier for lambda is always"
965,"Is there scheduling on lambda, or does that rely on another service?"
965,"Good point - I think it is technically a cloudwatch trigger, but it's not in front of me; I don't think that scheduling costs..."
965,Yeah it’s just a ttrigger; You can set a periodic trigger to fire lambdas
965,I removed my link because I think you can do it in the gui easier
965,"yup; and yep <@Mallie> CloudWatch trigger it is, with the expression set to 5 mins in this case"
966,What’s a good way to measure coverage via integration tests ? Anyone got ideas on how to deal with a legacy Django app?
966,"I'm not entirely sure you can <@Simonne> - are you meaning ""integration tests"" via selenium, or something else?"
965,"<@Patty> <@Mallie> <@Beula> Thanks! So, I have an AWS account already.. Sounds like ""CloudWatch Events"" is what I need to research?"
965,"Yeah, or lambda scheduled job should do it <@Georgia>"
965,Nice! Thanks <@Beula> I also have a Raspberry Pi sitting around somewhere.. might give that a go too
965,"<@Georgia> you shouldn't have to get too deep into cloudwatch to do the schedule, you should be able to add the trigger within lambda, that's just the source/type.; Just look at your *Triggers*"
965,<@Shanae> <#C0LMFRMB5|django> will be able to help :); <@Georgia> the pi is a great idea too. Either way we’ll be able to help :)
967,<@Beula> for selenium that is
967,"I’m not entirely sure you can, it would be pretty hard to analyze any of the Ui interactions and which python code path it took. Instead you could just test views with various form data inputs (or whatever is appropriate) to make sure the view handles your input as expected. That depends on assuming that the framework does what it claims (which is fairly reasonable, IMO) and that a dev wired the pieces to the Ui properly (a little harder)"
968,"Last question of today (I hope); Is this being ""as simple"" as Python demands?

969,"Aws isn’t the easiest to use a lot of the time, but the service and guarantees are quite good"

971,It's a lot to be sure
970,"Are you sure a release has been published on PyPI with that change? (Also, strictly speaking that python_version restriction is wrong, should be &lt; '3.4')"
970,"Status active, so it may not be shipped yet (I think that would be accepted). So I may have mislead. You may need to do it in a setup.py and conditionally append the requirement on install "
970,"<@Cynthia> I thought about that, but since the module doesn't say it support s python3.3, I left it.; <@Beula> I don't know how PyPi works.
I looked in the tar and found requires.txt doesn't have the condition.

973,filezilla?; use some ftp client
973,`paramiko`
973,"sftp client, or scp"
973,you could also do it with fabric which is pretty easy
973,"in case of sftp you don't need ftp server installed.
filezilla can manage sftp connection."
974,<@Meg> I know filezilla the stand alone app - are you saying there’s a filezilla library for python?
974,"<@Zaida> no, filezilla is just an alternative suggestion instead of a program.; The problem is you are using SSH; you should be using SFTP (the protocol filezilla uses); Paramiko is the most popular ssh/sftp lib that I know of; <http://docs.paramiko.org/en/latest/api/sftp.html>; an example usage: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/3635163>"
974,<@Zaida> is the real issue that you want to deploy your app to a server? Or are these just extraneous files to copy to a server?
975,<@Zaida> Do you need Python for this ? It’s quite easy to automate through just bash scripting (just call scp or rsync with the local and remote folder)
975,"I might not need python for it. This is the series of tasks I have
- from a spare laptop, scrape several websites (Can’t figure out how to make this headless as the sites are really complex and need Selenium as far as I can tell)
- Upload that data to my remote server where my app is.
- Trigger a Django management command that then processes that data and stores it to my database"
975,rsync over ssh might be  a nice easy way to do it
975,Hi; Can any1 advise me whats the diff b/w Web Scraping and Web Crawling?
975,"I’m trying to make that all into one script that just loops on a spare laptop. I realize this is a super terrible setup, but it’s just gotta work haha. It’s a small project, not a full development setup or something."
975,tq
975,"Short answer: Web crawling just indexes the information using bots, where as Web scraping aka web data extraction is an automated software technique of extracting information from web. Elaborated answer: Web crawling aka Indexing, is used to index the information on the page using bots also known as crawlers.; The latter. Just little csv files that I scrape and need to be uploaded. If I could I’d scrape from my server but try as I might, I can’t get that to work, so this seems like the best holdover until then."
975,"typically the former downloads the pages and content to a storage container, where the latter handles parsing and analysis in-memory on the spot"
975,<@Zaida> What “data” is sent ? It looks like it’s more something that could be done with celery + rabbitmq (As the laptop(s) would be the worker(s)
975,"<@Zaida> The simple answer is to only rely on one machine, if I were you I would just set up a cron job to run on the server. You could use AWS lambda to do it even. If you want to just load from where you are at, I would go with <@Junita> 's option of rsync over ssh (<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-copy-files-with-rsync-over-ssh>); The benefit of rsync is that it only syncs incremental files - so you get a redundancy locally"
975,"Oh, yeah, you'll need to change setup.py, I'm pretty sure. There's a couple of different suggested ways of doing that in various docs."
975,"Thanks for the help, man. When you say “Run a chron job on the server” i assume you mean to do the web scraping?
Unfortunately I’ve smashed my head against it but I just can’t get my webscraping to work with my remote server. It’s been a huge sticking point for me, making me spend ~10 minutes a day just to do the web scraping on my machine with Selenium. 
Part of the issue is the site I’m scraping. No API, and to quote a programmer friend who checked it out:
&gt; I don’t see an xml request being made when the export button is clicked so I’m thinking they’re storing the data in cookies via JavaScript and then the export page is reading the cookies on the server side. Or it’s some kind of cool React shit that I don’t know about.

So my selenium script has to click through the buttons one at a time and download a CSV from the site. 
I tried to get it up and going on my ubuntu server, but I couldn’t get firefox up and running well."
975,"Oh, my guess is the issue you are seeing is related to not having a ""virtual framebuffer"" (e.g. the browser needs libs to paint out the screen to work)"
975,"Interesting… Honestly it’s been over a year since I’ve tried it, so I don’t even recall the errors I was getting.  I might get some time to give it another shot. I think it was something to do with the rendering of images or some kind of color issue, so what you’re saying might be that.; about 30 small CSV files. The results of webscraping that (as of now) can only be done from a local machine and not on my server, unfortunately."

977,^ thats even crazier
976,but for that i’ll have to ask
976,with no tab completion I'm able to recreate the second case; on v3.4
976,"I think the tab completion and `help()` would have something in common: they would both require a “full” import of the module.
(As would <@Antionette>’s example of accessing `urllib.parse`)
Although that would suggest that the module in being “lazily” imported at first, which is not something I have heard of before"
976,"asked, and the reply was that it didn’t seem to matter; im on mac, no tab completion; so i can’t test"
976,"I’m on mac too, have tab completion"
976,weird… i hit tab and it just jumps over; <@Antionette> any ideas on what is going on there?
976,Might be different readline libs. I seem to remember getting fussy about that a few months back
976,"yea, just read something about that; <@Earline> john’s example is really what were trying to figure out"
976,"Appreciate that, just thought it interesting that it can be reproduced another way"
976,"it matches the behavior described in <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#submodules> - notably that ""For example, if package spam has a submodule foo, after importing spam.foo, spam will have an attribute foo which is bound to the submodule."" - implying that if the submodule is not imported there will be no attribute"
976,"oh no, im definitely interested in different ways to do it… but the core question is what is going on with the loading on attribute error; yes, but why is it there after the error?"
976,"not sure, it has to be that somehow trying to access the attribute causes the submodule to load"
976,"yea; just weird that it only happens on some machines / for some people; its gotta be some sort of config somewhere, just trying to learn where that is / what it is exactly; what version / os are you on?"
976,"3.4, ubuntu"
976,wonder if its a difference between readline and libedit?; but thats just for the cli though right?; shouldnt make a difference
976,not just for cli; meaning it happens whether in cli or from file
976,i know i also cant reproduce on centos; and the other person that could was also on ubuntu; but the ubuntu i tested on couldn’t reproduce
976,So it's only our guy and John Ferro that get it and they are on different versions?
976,yea; both on ubuntu though
976,I'm on ubuntu 14.04
976,"Cannot reproduce in `3.4.3 on CentOS 6.4`, `3.7.a on OSX 10.12`, `3.5.0 on OSX 10.12`, `3.6.2 on OSX 10.11`"
976,"k, he was on 16.04"
976,but he was python 3.5.1?
976,yea
976,"Mine is identical to his - it's probably the same repo, and I don't get it; Ubuntu 16.04 python3 package"
976,unless he installed via download from the site?
976,I know it's that one because for 3.6 I had to get it myself; Ah maybe but the date was even the same - but I guess I dunno what they do/don't do with building it for apt
976,"he seems pretty new to python also, so i doubt he did anything crazy"
976,"I told him to SO it, but if he doesn't want to I can"
976,"yea, figured id try here first"
976,"Totally fair, just figure get some more eyes on it since no one seems to have anything"
976,"<@Antionette> since you can reproduce it, can you try one more time, but after the error don’t call dir(urllib) just call urllib.parse again?"
976,"yeah tried that, it gets the attribute"
976,ok; cool / still weird; and do you remember if you installed via package manager or from a download?
976,package manager
976,"question… does the same work with request, instead of parse"
976,behaves the same as parse
976,ok; thanks
976,do you get True for this?; I'm assuming yes
976,umm…; wait; lol; typo; `False`
976,hmmm
976,but that should be the same
976,but then if you call `urllib.parse` it doesn't give the attribute error; but then it becomes true right?
976,as parse wont load for you until after the AttributeError
976,right
976,"the original question on this… parse, request, etc… were actually loading on the AttributeError for urllib.foo; its like the interpreter throws the error then loads everything just to make sure"
976,"yeah I'm seeing the same behaviour; and just to double check, for you/the correct behviour is that you can access `urllib.parse` from the beginning?"
976,"no; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib

976,ok so you have to explicitly import it
976,thats what most of us are seeing; dir(urllib) doesn’t change after the error
976,so it seems to be on any error; wait
976,wth… import after error too? thats new; <@Mallie> ^
976,"Does this happen for other modules, e.g. `logging` has a similar package structure to `urllib`, so what happens for

&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(logging)
```?"
976,hah - so it's the exception that triggers the import?
976,"no, he didn’t import urllib until after the error; <@Antionette> do that once more but call dir on urllib right after the error; lets see if it loads with the modules"
976,without importing?
976,"no, import urllib after error then call dir; see if parse is loaded before another error"
976,not sure if this is what you were looking for
976,yea
976,"well that makes sense, otherwise it would have given the attribute error in the above code"

If a situation fits the use of a generator I know of no particular reason you might want to avoid it.

992,"<@Myong> idk, does it need to be in the class?; If not, i feel its a bit better outside. "
992,I actually fixed that all up; I'm now stuck with another small issue; Basically I'm using the `Discord` python library and they use decorators for making groups and accessing commands that you can use. The issue I'm running into is that they use a keyword in the `@&lt;decorator&gt;` that is not initialized; so it gives an error for it and I know why but I'm just attempting to figure it out
992,More detail?
992,"One sec I'll put some small example together; Actually, I fixed it. I just decided to go with one small class and keep the main object inline and out of a class so that the decorators which use that variable later do not throw errors."

996,"<@Winnie> how so? `10 -&gt; 11`, but you need `11 -&gt; 10` from your example output."
996,@evan but they aren’t so it’s a moot point 
996,"<@Patty> I know, but what I'm asking is, is there someway to make them so"
996,<@Winnie> not without changing how lists fundamentally work
996,"<@Joie> 2.4 hasn't been updated in almost 10 years, 2.2 in almost 15. It's not worth writing bckwards compatible code for these versions. Especially as you can normally simply upgrade to 2.7 without many (if any) code changes."
996,<@Winnie> mind answering my question?
996,<@Patty> but a deque is a double ended linked list right?; <@Collette>
996,"Some are still on windows xp and RHEL 5. Does that mean we should always imply windows xp and RHEL 5 when talking about programming and such?; RHEL 4, even."
996,"No, but there are consideration to make. If you're writing a library for other users, then you should consider the version boundaries you wish to support. If it's your own internal, then it's a non-issue"
996,python3.5+; easy
996,"[a:[9, 10, 11]:b, c:[6, 7, 8]:d, e:[3, 4, 5]:f, g:[0, 1, 2]:h]
b is the end of the list, a then points to c, d then points to e...
you never need to access the inner elements, just the head and tail of each list; <@Collette>"
996,"Yep as <@Collette> says <@Carri> most people nowadays will only support 3+, 3.5+ especially with async features. A person writing a library should only have to consider what they personally need to support. It should the businesses/other peoples duties to fulfill the requirements of the software they ant to use, instead of forcing their requirements onto the provider; especially in open source where it is free; *when I say nowadays, I mean when starting a new library nowadays - not historical projects nowadays (although that looks to be starting to happen as well)"
996,<@Winnie> yes deque is linked lists under the hood in c land
996,<@Patty> so I guess the real moot point is that it's n time anyway since you'd have to convert
996,"<@Winnie> to be honest, if you care about such things you almost certainly picked wrong language"

996,"I don’t think there is any reason not to try to squeeze time out of python, or to do exercises to show best practices in terms of timing"

996,"<@Patty>, <@Collette> got a q about using redis as a backend for celery.  I have a ton of short lived tasks executing as part of a chord with a callback afterwards.  Due to the way a chord works, each task needs to return a result, which is saved in the task key in redis.

Over the weekend, got this error message in redis: 

`Can't save in background: fork: Cannot allocate memory`, 

with corresponding errors in the celery workers:

```ResponseError: Command # 1 (SET celery-task-meta-26aa6a83-2238-4f49-b3ec-555be58bfd91 {""status"": ""SUCCESS"", ""traceback"": null, ""result"": ""True"", ""children"": []}) of pipeline caused error: MISCONF Redis is configured to save RDB snapshots, but is currently not able to persist on disk.

996,"but apparently I'm overwhelming redis on the small instance I'm using; and there are still a large number of tasks waiting in the queue, since the workers aren't pickiung up; probably because of the redis issue"
996,"&gt; MISCONF Redis is configured to save RDB snapshots, but is currently not able to persist on disk
Disk IO is flying through the roof?"
996,"Yep.  Not surprising, since I have about 25 celery workers indexing web pages in solr; and since they're running as a chord, the results need to be saved"
996,"<@Winnie> your measurement is also incorrect. You should move `nl = deque()` to the body of the script from setup section; 25 workers? wow, that's huge"
996,"each task runs for about a half second to retrieve a web page, extract text with beautifuloup and insert into solr"
996,<@Collette> why?
996,and I have about 10M plus pages to index; got about 15% of the way over the weekend before this cropped up
996,"<@Winnie> because you're re-using a single instance of deque, it's shared between timeit invocations. But the point of `setup` is only to prepare data and things that should not affect the script itself (like imports); <@Meg> on a single box?"
996,<@Meg> are you on AWS? Their IOPS isn't good :confused:
996,"nope, three C4.Large instances; redis is running on a GP2 volume type, with 450/3000 IOPS"
996,<@Collette> oh you're saying that I'm actually extending onto the previous queues made?
996,I'd simply disable RDB snapshots in that case; <@Winnie> correct

999,"I'm assuming most people here use something like SQL Alchemy opposed to writing raw SQL, is that correct?"
999,"It varies. There is SQLAlchemy, someone just brought up Pony ORM but there was talk of python-mysql (name?) the other day. Others use Django. I would say ORM is probably more preferred, but that is just based on frequency of chatters."
998,"and use cases too; sure, an ORM doesn't cover every possibility, because SQL is pretty complex at times; and you should be familiar with the ORM library's downsides and use that to determine whether to use raw SQL or the library"
998,"I've found that SQL alchemy ends up adding quite a lot of overhead; That's personal hearsay though; I prefer to use the native MySQL DB python library, even though it makes life harder sometimes; But I'm open to change"
998,"how maintainable is that, though?; within  a team and whatnot"
998,"I've found creating helper functions has been helpful with that; But you are right that it has the potential to cause security concerns with poor data sanitzation; I don't have the real data behind SQLAlchemy slow-downs, but if you profile, you'll see that each time you do a select for example, it has to take a general data structure in and output a string. Because it's so generic though, there seem to be a lot of extra calls; Sounds like a good weekend project :slightly_smiling_face:"
998,"Interesting ok, thanks for the input guys. One more question, not super Flask relevant but:

Do you guys have a good resource / reference on best practices when writing a RESTful backend? 

To clarify, I'm wondering what most people do when 

* a required parameter was not sent
  - My decision so far has been to set the status code to `422`, but I don't know what the response JSON object should be... maybe `{}`?
* the required parameter that was sent was not found in the DB
  - My decision so far has been to set the status code to `404`, as the ID was not found, BUT again I don't know what the response JSON object should be..."
998,"For RESTful back-end, love both Flask and Eve; Eve I've found forces you to be more precise with what you want; There's a whole schema declaration you're doing and it comes with a MongoDB back-end basically; Flask I've found has more flexibility"
998,"Oh, I guess I'm talking not specifically about libraries/frameworks, but literally what to do when those events occur"
998,This presentation was from FOREVER ago; <https://www.slideshare.net/MikePearce/api-anti-patterns-4920731>; But you might find some nuggets in there
998,"Ok, thank you very much; This is the type of stuff I was looking for"
998,Is there a way to format links into text in slack? If there is it is lost on me.
998,<https://www.programmableweb.com/news/api-anti-patterns-how-to-avoid-common-rest-mistakes/2010/08/13>; That sums up his presentation much better - his slides were kind of all over the place
998,<@Mallie> no.; <@Rosamaria> this is a pretty good guide; <http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api>
998,Ooo - I like yours better
998,any resources on best practices to filter with optional query parameters without making a mess of code?
1000,can be general or django-specific
998,"I'm working on refactoring an api backend that is pretty messy; downside, there's six possible query parameters I have to account for, and only one is required"
998,<@Meg> What's it look like (if that is ok)?
998,"and that's _after_ I cleaned it up two years ago.  Before, it was far worse; at this point, I think its highly overcomplicated; and might be a case of lipstick on a pig to move forward without re-evaluating"
998,"Well `request.GET` permits lookup by key - so why repack them just to check for the one necessary, then just unpack them again anyway? You could just `request.GET.get()` or `[string] in request.GET` and remove most of that top code I'd think. I would check for the required field and leave immediately without any other processing personally. Also, if you want to use **kwargs, you could provide a mapping between kwarg and value then just provide them if they exist, if you are interested in making it more terse, since you are just ANDing things in your filter and exclude cases e.g. 

```
d={'catalog__institution__unitid': 1, 'catalog__institution__name__icontains': 2, 'catalog__institution__status': None}
**dict((key, value) for key,value in d.items() if value)
```

Can't these be grouped into a `filter` too: `Q(catalog__status = 'Verified') &amp; Q(name = 'Catalog Home')`. I'd only add the verbosity of Q for OR"
1001,"You might like `filter_params.get(field[5], None)` rather than your ternaries"
998,"This section is the most mysterious to me ```    # More custom query for filters
    custom_query &amp;= Q(catalog__institution__state = state)
    custom_query &amp;= Q(Q(flags__gte = 5) &amp; Q(media_type = 'PDF')) | Q(media_type = 'Web') | Q(media_type = 'Multi-Part PDF')
    custom_query &amp;= Q(catalog__status = 'Verified') &amp; Q(name = 'Catalog Home') &amp; Q(catalog__cataloglink__name = 'Catalog Home')```; It looks like some bitwise logic"
998,"In the Django ORM when working with querysets, the bitwise operators are overridden so you can do query building: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects>"
998,"basically, I need to explicityly filter based on those fields"
998,Ahhh; Thanks
998,I'm saying AND is encompassed fully in `filter` - if you need to OR you are stuck with `Q`
998,"and if you want to do a NOT query without using `exclude`, then you need to use a Q object; appreciate the thoughts :slightly_smiling_face:"

1003,"I work for a company that uses a lot of the python scientific packages. We use docker containers for running these packages currently. There are two issues I'm trying to figure out how to solve. First, what's the common methodology for storing/accessing large data locally? The large data is stored in the cloud - we are examining how that is stored right now, but it could be any back-end.
`from data_loader import some_data_set`. would be the ideal line. My thought was to do a staged caching mechanism, e.g. if the data exists locally, use it. If it doesn't, pull it. Has anyone ever stumbled across a design pattern similar to this?

Second, since everything runs inside a docker container, would it really be so wrong to, on program start, if we are not running inside our docker image, start it and redirect everything to run inside it?; 3rd, does anyone have any lessons learned from running their own PyPI server privately?; Finally, does anyone think I ask too many questions?"

1003,"<@Marcelina> interesting questions :slightly_smiling_face:; about the only issue I could see with you doing a staging mechanism is to ensure there’s enough storage locally before starting the download; second, I could see that being a good use pattern; third, sorry, can’t say"
1003,"That was my thought - and that was why I was wondering about running outside docker because inside docker, you got no idea how much is remaining"
1003,"with docker, you can symlink to external resources, correct?"
1003,"You can mount resources externally; But as a container, it's not really aware of the system space remaining"
1003,ah ok
1003,I think there's some workarounds I can do there
1003,"so, seems like you’d have to ensure creation of the container"

1015,"this is for our dev team, because we make a lot of changes in thsoe directories or we new stuff, and we need to display the last modified date to the front end, so i figured we might as well automate it, instead of hardcoding it everytime we make changes to the file; so this is my use case for now.; but other than that another use case would be to run tests before commiting but hey lol"
1018,"Okay so I'm getting closer and closer to figuring out my issues here. I have a twitter API streamer running asynchronously alongside a discord bot, also running with async. Now, when I receive information from twitter, the stream is set to call a function. Now the function it calls is not set as async or anything like that. So my question is, when I call a synchronous function within an async function, is that no long asynchronous?"
1018,"<@Myong> correct, you're only getting async behaviour when you yield"
1018,"<@Marcie> Okay, now it seems that tweepy uses `Threading.py` for async. I am wondering if I can just throw the whole TweepyStreamer object into an `asyncio` loop to get async behavior and as for the two functions I have just mark those with `async def` and use await for return values?; This issue is basically I have a bot for Discord that has it's own loop so when it runs it's blocking; I need to get the stream to run while the the discord bot is also running; Now the bot event loop is already making use of `asyncio`. Do you think that simply by putting the streamer as a whole into an event loop will fix the problem?; Seems like if I want to run a blocking task I have to use run in executor"
1019,"i dont know how the interaction with Threading.py works with asyncio so i couldn't answer that, might be a good candidate for <#C07G5276F|async>"
1018,"Okay thanks; Welp, didn't even realize they had webhooks so I think this shouldn't be too bad"

1021,so you’re using a connection pool with boto3 to fire off multiple calls?; boto3 is already using a connection pool
1021,"<@Meg>: this is how my code creates conn:

```
        self.ec2 = boto3.resource(""ec2"", region_name=region,
                                  aws_access_key_id=accesskey,

        sts = boto3.client(""sts"", aws_access_key_id=accesskey,
                           aws_secret_access_key=secretkey)

```; <@Meg>: i have added few msgs in _/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/boto3/resources/factory.py_
and the issue is coming from 
```
    def _create_autoload_property(factory_self, name, snake_cased,
...
...
            *return self.meta.data.get(name)*
...
```

and the exception coming because self.meta.data is None &amp; error string is : `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`"
1021,Sounds like a good case for a bug report on the boto3 github issue tracker 
1021,"<@Meg>: are we sure ?
Where should i file it ?

But its causing failures in my code :disappointed:"
1021,"Boto3 github ; If nothing else, you might get some pointers "
1021,"<@Meg> Okay, Thanks..!; <@Meg> Do you have any idea about Google-Cloud problem i'm facing ?
It seems that it's causing because of the library being not-thread-safe

Correct me if i'm wrong."
1021,"nope, sorry; don’t use google cloud at all, its all digital ocean or aws for me"
1021,"oh Ok :smile:; but sad to know that the problem of boto3 is causing problems at my side &amp; i am not able to bypass or workaround that..
kinda stops my work.."
1021,<@Florene> Are you sharing a single boto3 resource across threads? The docs say not to do that: <http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/resources.html#multithreading-multiprocessing>
1021,"<@Mallie>: actually i have a single python module &amp; the module init will have a connection aws-resources using boto3 &amp; the same connection variable is used by all the operations
and the problem is occurring when i trigger multiple snapshots, wherein the single client-connection would be used to perform multiple operations.."
1021,"<@Florene> Yeah I mean I had to read an issue or two and google for a few min (they should be clearer about this) but I think it definitely isn't thread safe, so if you are using the same connection, it's not going to work out for you; Comment in github that Resource should be made thread safe (opinion) is from 2016 and is still open"
1021,"ohh
you're telling this for google api library ?"
1021,no; boto3
1021,"oh
this is how i create connection in my code:

```
        self.ec2 = boto3.resource(""ec2"", region_name=region,
                                  aws_access_key_id=accesskey,
                                  aws_secret_access_key=secretkey)
        sts = boto3.client(""sts"", aws_access_key_id=accesskey,
                           aws_secret_access_key=secretkey)
```"
1021,this is nothing to do with google api; its all how you’re using boto3
1021,and i use self.ec2 at all places wherever and whenever needed; <@Mallie> Could you check whether what you've mentioned as not to be used is same as how i'm using/doing it
1021,all you’re showing there is how your instanciating the connection; not how you’re using it
1021,"Like <@Meg> said we aren't looking at that code, we are responding to

&gt; i'm getting boto3 error; And
&gt; i have a single python module &amp; the module init will have a connection aws-resources using boto3 &amp; the same connection variable is used by all the operations; It is _not_ thread safe, you need to initialize your resource in each thread if you want to do multi-threaded stuff"
1021,:point_up:
1021,"oh okay...
yeah
thats what the link says; and i think the problem is same for google-problem as well; it seems because of multi-threading only :disappointed:; i use same connection for multiple operatoins..; <@Mallie>: could you please provide the issue id for thread-safe issue mention?"
1021,Yeah sure: <https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/268>
1021,They also mention in their docs for multithreading to create a new resource instance for each thread or process: <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/resources.html#multithreading-multiprocessing> e: beaten by <@Mallie> a bit ago :slightly_smiling_face:

1021,"uh, what?  this applies to the code, not deployment environment"
1021,"<@Meg>: didn't get you, sorry"
1021,"google-library?; &gt;let me know if you think the same for google-library, thanks a ton _in advance_ .."
1021,"i meant - i faces few problems on using `google-api-python-client` library &amp; i think, the problems that i'm facing is because of the library not being thread-safe
so wanted your thoughts/confirmation on that one...; the problem i mentioned above, with stack
let me know if you are not able to find that"
1021,<@Florene> <https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/thread_safety>
1021,"yeah
<@Patty> even now - i just found the same
(y); Need to check what extra handling would be needed to make it thread-safe for my usage.."
1021,It won’t be thread-safe given the library it’s built on. Every request will need to have a new httplib2 object
1021,"&gt; Need to check what extra handling would be needed to make it thread-safe for my usage..
Don't, that is the wrong path here.; Those are not easy problems, you should adjust your program to use the library within the restriction of not being thread safe."
1021,"oh
should i not try to handle the issue ?
i mean - say - i have multiple requests coming in &amp; then i should serve as much requests as possible
and to achieve what i was thinking was to create session/connection whenever the request comes up &amp; processing would happen differently for each requests and each of them will have their own session/connection, right ?"
1021,"basically, if you are using modules that aren’t thread safe, then do not multithread or process them"
1021,"ok.
but that also means - the request serving would be serial &amp; nothing can happen in parallel, right ?"
1021,"What <@Patty> is saying is don't use the _modules_ incorrectly. You are free to create multithreaded code, but don't use non-threadsafe components across threads.; Just create a new boto3 resource for each thread if that is what you want to do"
1021,"okay..
got it...; Tnx"

1023,"I have some learning questions if someone has some time.
```some_list_comprehension = [
    temp_variable.field_of_interest
    for temp_variable in a_callable
    if temp_variable.my_question_here is some condition
]```
First, conceptually are there any problems with the template?"
1023,"no, that's correct for a list comp"
1023,"thanks, my question is about if temp_variable.my_question_here...; does Python know whether it's looking for a key or a field or a whatever after the period by inferring from the expression/a_callable  ?; I would imagine generally one would iterate over something searching for say a field in a class or in a value for a given key AND that Python looks at the ""in"" statement to determine how/what it is looking for.  Am I imagining correctly?"
1023,"For the most part, Python doesn’t do dot accessors like JavaScript; So, for a dictionary, you would need to do `dict['key']`"
1023,"To add on to what <@Patty> said, in `temp_variable.my_question_here` `my_question_here` is an attribute, and if it does not exist you will get `AttributeError`, see doc for `getattr()` and `setattr()` to handle getting/setting attributes by name; It's not a key/value pair"
1023,"I'm thinking that I keep seeing list to list comprehension and that it's more about what I've been seeing than what Python can do.; Continuing on the attribute part, is that why I can have a list of Class instances and iterate through the attributes of the Classes in the list?"
1023,"Yeah because each `temp_variable` has a `my_question_here`; If it didn't, you'd get the exception"
1023,I don't think I'm crystal clear on what is an attribute vs field.  Time to dig into the docs.; Thanks for the help <@Frieda> <@Patty> <@Mallie>
1023,<@Seema> I could be wrong but I don't think Python ever explicitly refers to those as fields. Are you referring to fields in the Django sense of things? They define and heavily leverage that term.
1023,"In a class, there are a set of class ""things"", dunders, methods, class lists,etc.  I honestly don't have the confidence to say what the exact name is - in the terminology sense - of each of those things."
1023,"yeah, there's really no such Python thing as a ""field"", AFAIK"
1023,What's the proper name for self.__thing__ ?
1023,classes only have two member types. attributes and methods; attributes are variables that are scoped to a class/instance; methods are functions that are scoped to a class/instance
1023,are there any weird edge cases like a Class havinga  Class or is attributes and methods only?
1023,a class having a class... I can't think of any way to do that that wouldn't make it an attribute
1023,"attribute and method it is, thanks"
1023,"you can't really have a nested class, like you could have a nested function; classes have inheritance, of course, but that's not the same"
1023,"<@Frieda> 
```
class MyModel(db.Model):
    ...
    class Meta:
        database = some_db_connection
        
```; It's a somewhat common way to store meta attributes in some ORMs"
1023,"sure but that's handled through some behind-the-scenes abc magic that actually nests it into an attribute; `MyModel._meta` usually; it's not a plain-ol-Python-object, AFAIK"
1023,works in REPL :confused:
1023,"hmm. very well; OK, while _possible_, it's _uncommon_. how about that? :smile:"
1023,"Maybe old-style classes from py2 couldn't do it?; &gt; while _possible_, it's _uncommon_.
Yeah, but I wish it was more common."
1023,"re: py2, maybe? re: wishing it was more common, I'm not sure how I feel about that. I kinda like things to be flatter"
1023,"Flat is indeed better than nested.. But it just looks so cute and simple!; I mean, you know what it does right away, without even having worked with nested classes before."

1026,"Hey guys, what technical approach would you recommend to the following situations:
My web app has notifications. When a certain global thing is created (e.g new feature added), I want every user to receive a notification.
I’m thinking of passing this message (that a new thing was created) to my `notifications` service, which would use the `Process` class to create a new process and run the function which would iterate through all the users there. Is this alright?"
1024,"<@Patty> :

In my code, i create connection to google-cloud-compute by creating object like below:
```
compute = discovery.build(""compute"", ""v1"", credentials=credentials)
```

if i create `discovery.build` for each object ( as in for each request ), that would involve concurrent processing of Cloud Resources, using different resources AND 
with this - would it not fail ? in case if there are lot of requests ?
should there be a limit on how many `discovery.build` my code should fork ?
or there is no limit ?

same question can also be put up as :Should i use counting semaphore or something of that sort ?
To avoid creating n number of `discovery.build` objects. ?"
1026,<@Tatum> I’d just use an async task queue to do that for you
1026,Ah but I’d run it in a server which already uses some; I figured there’s no sense to add more when I could just spawn another process; Since the work is independant
1026,that’s what an async task queue is for
1026,"ah f, it’d do it (spawn the process) itself  huh"
1026,"celery has the concept of workers; which are independent processes that pick up jobs from a message queue, execute and then wait for another job to arrive"
1026,yeah
1026,please don’t make your own unless you _really_ know what you’re doing.  I had to clean up a big mess from a previous dev who tried doing exactly what you’re doing
1026,You’re completely right; I have celery set up as well; This is just another task
1026,yup :slightly_smiling_face:
1026,Talk about over-engineering
1026,"now, you’d just have to have your client-side do a poll on an interval to check for notifications"
1026,"Thanks for clearing this up, I had a hunch it wasn’t the right approach"
1026,":slightly_smiling_face:; somehow, the guy got his version running moderately well, but it didn’t handle issues very well and would consistently crash.  One of the first things I did was bring in Celery into the project and migrate everything over"
1026,Yeah that’s the thing right? Handling errors and reporting back/retrying adequately
1026,"_much_ more reliable, and you’ve already passed the third hurdle; exactly; that’s the difference between a toy project and something that’s production-ready: how it handles things you don’t expect; so, one area I’m unclear on; are you using polling on the client to check for updates?"
1026,the client as in who?; the one spawning the task?
1026,"no. you have a web app, so I assume its consuming an API; both browser and mobile capable"
1026,oh that’s a whole other separate thing
1026,how are you looking for updates in that?; because you can have the notifications in the server
1026,there’s a specific notifications server which accepts websockets
1026,:thumbsup:
1026,"it is connected to the main app through RabbitMQ; and is listening for notifications, once it receives one it checks if the recipient is connected and if he is - he receives a notif"
1026,good idea; and you’ve thought it through
1026,so what the celery task would do is create the `Notification` object and maybe send a message through rabbitmq
1026,are you using rabbit as the backend for celery?
1026,yeah
1026,ouch…
1026,"they’re two separate instances though, methinks; why, whats wrong with that"
1026,I really wouldn’t reccommend it; not advised in the docs
1026,wow really
1026,redis is more stable
1026,"I’ll need to revisit them, then; This started out as a hackathon project and my initial idea was to just get celery working"
1026,"I used rabbit as both the broker and backend in the first iteration; what ended up happening, it was storing the results in memory, as well as the jobs"
1026,and they got lost? :smile:
1026,"and eventually everything clogged up so the workers weren’t picking up new jobs; yep, and server crashed, everything was lost"
1026,"wow, how is that scenario not handled; it’s not that hard to predict it clogging up and eating all the memory, wonder why Celery hasn’t done anything about it; AFAIA RabbitMQ has something like durable queues which store the data ?"
1026,"<https://denibertovic.com/posts/celery-best-practices/>; maybe they have, with 4.x; I’mm using 3.1.x"
1026,mhm; Thanks for the information :slightly_smiling_face:
1026,"so, I moved to redis for result storage; since that’s basically what its built for: fast, concurrent key-value storage"
1026,"wait, result storage?; As in the results of a task?"
1026,"no, return of task; eg, task state, return values, etc"
1026,"wow, look what I use; <https://github.com/celery/django-celery-results>; and I used to query the model haha"
1026,"gotcha.  I use redis for that, mainly because there are alot of short-term tasks to execute; if I were to use that, the writes to db would be significant; I do have tasks that write to the database; but they do a query and update inside the task, and that’s for the more infrequent, longer-running tasks"

2) The above comment `you are typing from half an hour` is insulting when people are trying to help you"
1027,"it's obvious that you are not my wife. so what should i call you. by saying dear, i am giving you respect.; why will i insult you?; please understand."
1027,"I do, it's a cultural thing and I accept that; but I also need to explain to you that these are innapropriate things to say, especially on an English speaking forum"
1027,so tell me the correct word?
1027,"In my opinion there is no correct replacement, you simply do not need to use any pronouns. simply ""i have explained the question, did nothing else"" is enough; The closest correlate in english would be Sir/Ma'm, but neither are appropriate in this context"
1027,"ok...means you do not want respect.; but sir, answer my question with the help of suitable sample example."
1027,"My answer is not what you are looking for; And it is not that I do not want respect, it is that English naturally uses a respectful tone (e.g. You is the respectful form of the 2nd person); We dropped the less respectful stuff centuries ago; <@Lemuel> There is a link at the top of this channel: <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask>

I suggest you read it.

I understand you would like us to help you solve this problem, and we would love to help you. As a result each of us has a duty.

Your duty is to do as much research and work as is possible into the problem area - to really try to understand it and attempt more solutions than simply `clipboard.copy(""abc"")`.

You need to gain a real understanding for the problem you are facing and come up with a plan or two to tackle it - and then attempt those plans. Once you have done that, if you still have issues, you should come to us. Explain what you've tried and, as <@Meg> explained, tell us what roadblock you've hit and why you think you've hit it.

Our duty then is to try and point you in the direction of resources which can help you with the problem - or to explain bugs you've introduced that we can see (because you should share your code so we can see).

If you do not have a coherent or complete plan, or lack the understanding required - we point you in the direction of resources to help you. This is what we have done so far.

What we will not do is solve your issues for you. Firstly because you will not learn as a programmer, your own progression will suffer, and we would not have really helped you in the long term. Secondly, because you are not paying us and we do not have time to solve everyones issues - this is not a crowdsourced development platform.; You have asked for help from us, which is fine. We have offered suggestions to help you help yourself.; Show us you have taken that on board and have tried instead of dismissing it; If you feel you have spent too much time on the problem, take a break and come back another time when you feel ready to try again."
1028,"Saw this function in a library I use. Curious as to what exactly happens here.

```def redispatch(obj, device_type, session_prep=True):
    """"""Dynamically change Netmiko object's class to proper class.
    Generally used with terminal_server device_type when you need to redispatch after interacting
    with terminal server.
    """"""
    new_class = ssh_dispatcher(device_type)
    obj.device_type = device_type
    obj.__class__ = new_class
    if session_prep:
        obj.session_preparation()```

obj is having it's __class__ changed to a new class. What happens when this line is executed? Is it something along the lines of `obj = NewClass()` and in the __init__ will run? Would the init be skipped since this doesn't seem to be instantiating a new instance of an object?; `ssh_dispatcher` returns reference to a class in the above code, not an instance of the class."
1028,"<@Meghan> It simply changes what `__class__` is, I am quite certain the `__init__` would not be run, since, as you correctly pointed out, this happens when an instance is created.; My guess is that `obj.session_preparation()` sets whatever instance properties are needed that differentiates this class from the original class and the idea is to reduce overhead (so rather than instantiating a new object with all of the data that is needed from this object)."
1028,I guess I had not imagined that being a thing. May have to give it a try some time.
1028,seems like it would be a delicate task to make sure `obj.session_preparation()` does everything right. Presumably the old and new classes are expected to be _quite_ similar
1028,"Yeah, everything is inherited from one class.; It looks like the session_preparation method does stuff like disabling paging and entering into enable mode.; If the class had instance variables that were different i guess they would include them in that method."
1028,"Good evening guys, has anyone ever had the weird problem that execution stops while instantiating an object but throws no errors?; It's killing me:"
1028,I would guess something in that object is blocking indefinitely or has an infinite loop.
1028,As far as I can see it doesn't
1028,depends? what is in your `__init__()`?
1028,main: instantiate object x: x__init__(xmlobject) parses xmlobject and assigns self.variables based on it's contents ... execution continues until doing self.year = xmlsubobject.text; I'm very confused; Are allowed to paste code here or should I fire a pastebin?
1028,<@Kym> use snippets to format your code
1028,The __init__ is quite long
1028,theyr'e under the +
1028,<@Kym> <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet>
1028,The __init__ is in the beginning
1028,Can you tell us where it is blocking?
1028,"Execution stops at line 51, 54 or 56; If I delete 51, it block at 54; and so on"
1028,Also you can set the language in a snippet to format it/colourise etc.; How big is the xml?
1028,"KK, should be better now.; 25000 elements"
1028,in mb
1028,I had no problem before; 329mb; I just wanted to tidy it up a bit
1028,Hmmm I'm assuming you have a few GB of ram
1028,16GB
1028,"yeah; Either way do me a favour, run it but with a system monitor open and watch the RAM usage"
1028,"But, how can it be? It happen also with my test.xml"
1028,329 isn't big but it isn't small
1028,And that one is only a couple of kb.; The test file is.; -rw-rw-r--  1 ghost ghost  69K Oct  3 14:09 test.xml
1028,Have you verified the xml is valid?
1028,"Yup; A; As I mentioned, it used to work; When I only used Jupyter; Now I took the XML; parsing logic out of the function itself and magically ... broken; Haha :slightly_smiling_face:; It also used to work with the 400mb and the 1.5gb files I have"
1028,How have you verified where it stops?
1028,"Logging; The funny thing is:; 1. execution apparently never leaves instantiation of article=PubmedArticle(elem); 2. magically, the execution continues after the end of the loop; That means,; line 251 STILL gets executed!!"
1028,What exception is being raised?
1028,NONE!
1028,Which line is that one <@Kym>
1028,"incidentally, in that last line of the `__init__`, do you mean `self.authorslist` instead of `self.authors`?"
1028,"<@Vada>, which one do you mean?; <@Sirena>, I'll check sec."
1028,The one you are talking about ion 1; article=PubMedArticle
1028,"<@Sirena>, you're right. That point still isn't reached.; I've fixed it, though.; line 188; The print('HELLO') I put in the snippet is never reached."
1028,"yah, didn't really think it was the issue, but figured I'd mention it while I was looking at it"
1028,Wait ...
1028,Can you give us the snippet htat calls `medxml_to_sqlite`?
1028,<@Kym> the finally will always execute error or not
1028,Yup!
1028,That you don't receive one is odd; as in receive an error
1028,I'll remove the try/except andsee if it shows me something; I'm not passing it though
1028,Yeah that would be best - not good to except Exception
1028,"<@Meghan> medxml_to_sqlite('../data/test.xml','../data/test.sqlite')"
1028,"Yeah, I'm thinking there is an exception, but the calling function is silently handling it when it is raised."
1028,Yeah make sure you set your logging to DEBUG for everything if it isn't already
1028,"The whole function that calls medxml_to_sqlite, if you can."
1028,"also on line 201, keywordslist is undefined; <@Kym> what are you using as your IDE?; Jupyter?"
1028,"Or, throw in a log.exception at line 247"
1028,Jupyter yup
1028,If the Exception were hitting there though it'd be raised - you are saying Jupyter is suppressing it?
1028,Never tried jupyter
1028,But it also behaves in the same way on pycharm; Have both
1028,"Is Jupyter calling that function itself, or is another function calling it?"
1028,But in pycharm the code analysis looks like this:
1028,"(I've not used Jupyter, so I'm clueless on how it works.)"
1028,"orange = warning, red = error"
1028,Jum ...
1028,and a lot of the warnings are potential errors
1028,"Yeah, that red is stuff that will break your code."
1028,Mine doesn't show anything.
1028,so might be worth double checking your code
1028,Let me see if I can configure it to show the analysis.
1028,No idea if jupyter does; but I recommend pycharm :wink:; and they support jupyter notebooks; <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-ipython-jupyter-notebook-with-pycharm.html>
1028,Does Jupyter include an editor? I didn't realize that.
1028,"I've got to go, but I really think the calling function is ignoring the raised exception, either with suppress or a blanket try/except."
1028,"Yup, is not very good but I like it to scratch stuff and then I try to refactor it in Pycharm; I think this is it:"
1028,Does it have a hook for like pyflakes or anything? Any kind of syntax checking?
1028,Even if it's not it it's still an issue
1028,"So I'll test two things:; exception being swallowed somehow; perhaps those lines trigger the exception; that's why when I remove set year, day, month execution continues until next assignment"
1028,"IIRC you don't re-set `datetime` atttributes, you use replace: <https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.replace>; So it seems like it is catching your Exceptions and logging them; ```

In [15]: today = dt.today()

1028,<@Marcie> Did you ever figure it out?
1028,I'm on it! :slightly_smiling_face:; I can't bring the damn thing to generate <@Mallie>'s exception.; But I think that's it problem with setting the date+exception getting lost somehow
1028,"<@Kym> What is the output of `import sys; sys.excepthook`?; In the interpreter where this is happening of course, so however you make that happen in a Jupyter notebook."
1028,"OK:
1. the exception <@Mallie> pointed out was indeed one of the problems. The fact that I tried to set pubdate.year and month triggered the exception ""AttributeError: attribute 'month' of 'datetime.date' objects is not writable"" 
2. Now, the interesting part is why the exception was being ""swallowed."" It was because I put the return clause in the finally block!

    finally:
        curs.connection.commit()
        curs.connection.close()
        return len(root.getchildren())

vs.

    finally:
        curs.connection.commit()
        curs.connection.close()
    return len(root.getchildren()); Does it make sense that the exception is hidden just because I put the return clause in the finally block? ... I broke Python? heh"
1028,"&gt;If finally is present, it specifies a ‘cleanup’ handler. The try clause is executed, including any except and else clauses. If an exception occurs in any of the clauses and is not handled, the exception is temporarily saved. The finally clause is executed. If there is a saved exception, it is re-raised at the end of the finally clause. If the finally clause raises another exception or executes a return or break statement, the saved exception is discarded; Nice one!; <https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement>"
1028,"HOLY CRAP!; That makes no sense ... I'll read it, give me a sec"
1028,interesting find
1028,Now the interesting part ... print(sys.version): 3.5.3
1028,seems like return inside of finally should be discouraged pretty broadly
1028,"Yes, but the docu doesn't say anything.; I'm using python2; <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html>; the only mention of return is the following:; ""A finally clause is always executed before leaving the try statement, whether an exception has occurred or not. When an exception has occurred in the try clause and has not been handled by an except clause (or it has occurred in an except or else clause), it is re-raised after the finally clause has been executed. The finally clause is also executed “on the way out” when any other clause of the try statement is left via a break, continue or return statement. A more complicated example:"""
1028,"I linked to the reference docs, that's where the quote comes from"
1028,For python2; But I'm using python 3; IN the 3docs it says nothing about discarding exceptions; :open_mouth:
1028,"Oh, you said
&gt; I'm using python2; Yeah not sure, can't check atm"
1028,"Oh, I did. My bad."
1028,But maybe it's not as clear lol
1028,I mean it's pretty logical it's going to discard one if a second exception is raised in the finally; I don't really see how they could have done different
1028,"the 3 docs have it in there also; about a page down
<https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally>; ```If finally is present, it specifies a ‘cleanup’ handler. The try clause is executed, including any except and else clauses. If an exception occurs in any of the clauses and is not handled, the exception is temporarily saved. The finally clause is executed. If there is a saved exception it is re-raised at the end of the finally clause. If the finally clause raises another exception, the saved exception is set as the context of the new exception. If the finally clause executes a return or break statement, the saved exception is discarded:```"
1028,Good find <@Shavonda>; Bu; But I still believe it should be mentioned in /tutorial/errors
1028,I agree with you
1028,"So, the novel has concluded :3

try:
...
except Exception as e:
raise(e)
finally:
curs.connection.commit()
curs.connection.close()
return len(root.getchildren())

So:

1. A finally clause is always executed **before** leaving the try statement,
- so execution looks like so: try&gt;finally&gt;except
2. whether an exception has occurred or not
- in this case an exception occurred in the try block
3. When an exception has occurred in the try clause and has not been handled by an except clause
- in this case the exception wasn't handled by the except clause because there was a finally
4. it is re-raised after the finally clause has been executed
- but the finally clause returns, so we leave context and never come back to execute the except block; Jum ... what's the preferred way to suggest changes to the docu?; Pull request?"
1028,"Well tutorial is kinda more ""things you should do or most people do do"", the reference should be complete; But, a fun gotcha I'll give you that"
1028,"""fun"" ... speak for yourself :stuck_out_tongue:"
1028,"Stumpers are the best errors!; You grew, even if you don't know it yet :evergreen_tree:"
1028,"That's true; Thanks for helping everyone, I wasn't expecting this bug to be so ... ""insightful?"" :slightly_smiling_face:"
1028,"it's still try &gt; except &gt; finally; but if you have
```except Exception as e:
  raise (e)
finally:
  return 'something'```; the `raise (e)` doesn't do anything, because the finally runs after it, discarding the exception"
1028,"<@Kym> Yeah, nice interview question! lol"
1028,"or at least, that's the way it looks to me; really the more I think about this, the more I think it should be a warning to put return inside finally, but maybe there's a corner case where it's appropriate"
1028,"I agree, <@Sirena>"
1029,Regarding your second statement
1028,"Regarding the second one I'd still say it's try&gt;except&gt;finally; It says, finally is always executed after try; Otherwise it wouldn't work; I mean, the purpose of finally is to be executed before execution is terminated; and this happens after the raise; no?"
1029,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
...  print('one')
...  1/0
... except:
...  print('two')
... else:
...  print('...')
... finally:
...  print('three')
... 
one
two
three
```"
1028,"Hm ...; What if we do a raise instead of print('two'); ?; Does print('three') happen before th; the raise or after? I think it makes a difference, let me try.; line 7 is never executed; even without the return; which makes sense ... because that's what raise is for; Hm ... the sequence is indeed:
try &gt; except &gt; finally
The only problem was that although raise triggered an exception and the exception was saved, return led to it being discarded."
1030,"I'm looking to level up.  I was debating between [Git, debugging/IDE, concept deep dive in Python like decorators/metaclasses, something else].  I'm out of n00bie and into rookie territory.  Any suggestions?"
1030,When you say git <@Seema> do you mean you don't have experience with version control or you want to dig into git guts?
1030,inexperienced with version control
1030,"Do that - pick some sort of task you want to accomplish and use git to do it and track changes, etc. and so on; In terms of ""things"" developers do, after you understand basic logic, that is the most necessary and pragmatic thing"
1030,"yeah, and it might be a false choice, you'll probably learn a bit of everything as you go along"
1030,"In terms of ""doing"" code, it is absolutely essential to not just having a rat's nest history"
1030,"OK, thanks.  I've been using PyCharm.  Would you suggest using version control through there or go full command line crazy for the learning part?"
1030,"Dunno PyCharm so get another opinion. I do it on the command line personally (and gitlab, github, etc.); But I am mostly comfortable on the command line"
1030,"try both I would say. command line git isn't what I would call user friendly, but it does give you the most power and flexibility"
1030,"What matters is concepts, for the most part, so it depends how/where you want to work IMO; If PyCharm abstracts a lot of what git works is _meant_ to do, I'd be kinda meh about that...; But I really doubt that, it's probably just a nice wrapper; I changed that - I mean to imply _why_ VC and not _how_ VC; Though the how is cool; Also if you ever care to contribute to OSS <@Seema> it's obviously essential, plus, as you read diffs and patches and make sense of commits, etc. you'll get better at interpreting/reading code, which is something I know you are working on"
1030,"I use PyCharm, but for a variety of team-related reasons I use the command line for git interactions"
1030,"Alrighty, after all the laundry I've been avoiding and the grocey shopping, I'll dig into git and pycharm and CLIgit and check it out from there."
1030,":thumbsup: git 4 lyfe; And remember, if you're friends don't use git, tell them they are wrong everyday :trollface:"
1030,"Umm...okay, ""Joshua says you are wrong"".  :wink:"
1030,"Nah, the Internet or Hacker News says that lol"
1030,"ya dang kids, some of us had to do VC before git"
1030,I've already concluded that I PyCharm + git is not the way I'm going.
1030,now get off my lawn
1030,"<@Seema> would you say it's more PyCharm you're not going to use, or more git?"
1030,The act of learning the concepts of git and the workflow and then adding a layer of PyCharm learning how to do the things seems to muddy the waters from the first 5 minutes of video watching and post reading.  I don't know in the future but for the learning CLI only now.
1030,<@Patty> <https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290#comments>
1030,"committed by Linus Torvalds Apr7, 2005"
1030,best README ever; Also <@Seema> the workflow and concepts of git are going to be the same whether they are CLI or in PyCharm
1030,"<@Patty> I get that but the layer of abstraction is a button or interface I would be ""learning"" and I can come back to the later (or not).  The tutorials all have that click here, click there on how to use git in PyCharm."
1030,"It’s just clicks vs. commands. A lot of the naming overlaps as well. In my experience most people get frustrated and move to CLI, which is used more, and has a lot more resources online"
1030,"so...you're suggesting that learning git through PyCharm will not be ""noisy""?"
1030,some things are harder to do than with CLI. personally what i’ve seen from my students was ditching something in a program for CLI so that they are interacting with git a bit more “closely” and it lends to better understanding/learning. It also makes things difficult if you are on a machine without PyCharm; I’ve found that CLI + a GUI tool like SourceTree (if you are a visual person and like to see state of a repo that way) works best
1030,"yeah, a GUI tool of some kind is important"
1030,depends on the learner and the goals. some people go into SourceTree and then lean on it for a longgg time
1030,I think git ships with a tool called `gitk` which will provide a minimal GUI; at least in most common packages for git
1030,different packages
1030,"I don't use a GUI for git day-to-day, and the only ones I ever have were github/gitlab, but everyone is different"
1030,"<@Seema>, I wrote a Git tutorial for me and my friends a while ago. I found most of the documentation online to shallow or to deep. Perhaps it resonates with you:
<https://sentheon.com/blog/easy-git-guide-and-reference-for-the-busy.html>"
1030,"<@Kym> :taco:; off to lunch, laundry, learn, thanks for resource"
1031,"So I'm falling victim to copying code from SO without understanding how it works. I have this ranking function:

```
def get_ranks(item, dictionary, reverse):
    dictionary_sorted = sorted(dictionary.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=reverse)
    rank, count, previous, result = 0, 0, None, {}
    for key, num in dictionary_sorted:
        count += 1
        if num != previous:
            rank += count
            previous = num
            count = 0
        result[key] = rank
    return result[item]
```

I have 1,013 key, value pairs in my dictionary. 698 of them have a value of 100 so they should all be ranked #1, then the next non-100 value should be ranked 699. Instead, they're all ranked 698th. Any idea how to get the starting rank at #1 when they're all the same?"
1031,"I'm confused, are you re-sorting the dictionary every time you ask for one of its entries?; if you pick 3 entries from your dictionary, what output are you expecting, and what are you getting?"
1031,"Ya - I am re-sorting the dict every time I ask for a rank, which is dumb so i should definitely re-do that.

For example, I have 3 keys, all with scores of 100: `{'key1': 100, 'key2': 100, 'key3': 100, 'key4': 50}`. It's currently returning ranks like 'key1'=3, 'key2'=3, 'key3'=3, 'key4'=4, but I want it as 'key1'=1, 'key2'=1, 'key3'=1, 'key4'=4"
1031,"when I run that, I get 1,1,1,4"
1031,<@Sirena> I'm very glad you said that cause I read through the code like 3 times and thought it looked like it was working as wanted; because the rank only updates after a change in value
1031,"It's strange - it actually works for most of my dicts, but on a couple it gives the behavior I described."
1031,for the ones where it doesn't work are the values classes instead of a simple data type?
1031,Nope...it's a django aggregation (`Avg`).; Of a `FloatField`
1032,can you print an exact example of one of the dicts that doesn't work?
1031,"When I dumped that same dict to a json and ran the `get_rank` function outside of Django it returned all the 100's as ranking 113...; Ya it's just really long, but I'll post the dict in a snippet.; All those values of 999999 are just there to be ranked last automatically."
1032,"this is tricky, nothing stands out to me as why that would be. python version?"
1031,3.5.2; Did you get those same weird results?
1032,"maybe, but it looks like there are values less than 100 (`""13801"": 96.0`) so I'm not sure what the expected behavior is"
1031,"well...say there are fifty scores of 100. I want it to rank all those 50 as rank #1, then rank the next highest score of 99.0 (or whatever) as rank #51. Right now it's ranking all those fifty scores of 100 as rank #50, then the next highest score is ranked #51."
1032,I'm assuming if 100 is the first number though right?; do you know what 100 should be in your example
1032,ohhhhhh wait I think I know what's happening; its ranking 999999 higher than 100 (obviously). Later on I change those 999999 to 'N/A' values in the table.; that's definitely the issue - thanks for getting me to the solution haha :slightly_smiling_face:
1032,lol pn; np; ah you were not reversing; I thought you were going in ascending ordering; because of the 99999s lol; so that makes sense; glad you got it
1032,haha ya - that took an embarrassingly long time to realize my mistake
1031,"I am wondering, does Wheel specification provide any security for binaries? how can we be certain that the compiled extension hosted on Pypi is really compiled from that src that author states? (besides compiling by ourserves and checking diff)?"

1036,there u go :slightly_smiling_face:
1036,"Thing is, I'm not running webpack at the moment.; I fail to see what's wrong with the path. =/"
1036,possible it's in your browser cache or something ?
1036,"Woahhhh I just notice something weird, Is there a difference between 127.0.0.1 and localhost?; <@Ciera> I was thinking that could be the case.

localhost:5000 seems to be serving cached files. The flask server only logs a couple requests but chrome sees many, whereas if I point my browser to 127.0.0.1:5000 then the flask logs show that all files are being uploaded and I am now able to see my missing bundle.js (as expected)."
1036,:thumbsup:
1036,I still fail to see why `localhost:5000 != 127.0.0.1:5000`
1036,it's the same but chrome cache might handle it like two different address; so a cache for localhost and a different one for 127.0.0.1
1036,devtools cache should be disabled =/; ... and thats false!; apparently i was caching :facepalm:; Always love a good kick to the soul. Builds character.
1036,;D it happens to everyone
1036,"Onto the next question. I'm getting this non-deterministic problem where sometimes I get a file uploaded more than once. I'm thinking that could be a gunicorn thing, but I'm not certain.; Actually, I revoke this question until I noodle around a bit. I'll come back to it later if it persists."
1036,"<@Kayce> in addition, localhost allows you to have some security exceptions, like when using the browser geolocation api and iframes… at least with chrome.  Not sure if they still apply to `127.0.0.1` or in other browsers.  That’ll let you do some dev work with those two, without requiring SSL in the former and dealing with lots of special cases with the latter"
1037,"setting up mailchimp, using python api <https://github.com/charlesthk/python-mailchimp> and I have on mailchimp an existing list of emails I want to add to. Anyone ever tried this before?"
1037,"i have a csv file with ~2million rows (1.5gb) and need to process its contents - e. g. read out column 6 entry of each row and store it in a `dict` or `set` - anybody has ideas for an efficient solution? 

(i am running on latest mac, 16gb, python 2.7)"
1037,I believe the stdlib csvreader use a generator so you can use that and process it line by line; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17444679/reading-a-huge-csv-file>
1037,"<@Aimee> any chance you can import to a database and use python to retrieve the data from there?; that would allow you to use the db for faster queries, analysis and such, without having to re-read and import the data upon each program execution"
1037,"<@Ciera> thanks for your message. i actually read the exact same article not too long ago. it looks like using a generator is the only smart idea. but i am not sure when talking about 2m rows; <@Meg> thanks for you message. unfortunately, i cant. i am receiving this as an export myself. now i have to deal with it that way :slightly_smiling_face:"
1037,db is definitively a better idea. If you use correctly generator is the number of rows shouldn't matter; but it can be slow
1037,"Oof, OK. Then I'd try out <@Ciera>'s suggestion"
1037,well you can still insert it in a db the first time and afterwards use the db
1037,<@Ciera> i have to admit i do not have that much experience working with generators - especially at that scale.; <@Ciera> <@Meg> i normally tend to use google drive and read files through the google api but this file is too large for google drive
1037,"basically, a generator will only pop off one row at a time, which is called `yield`ing; that way it doesn’t have to hold the whole CSV in memory"
1037,if you follow the SO post it should be :thumbsup:
1037,"<@Patty> thank you. yes, i totally understand the concept of generator functions. just havent written and worked with many of them myself"
1037,if all you want is the unique values in column 6 then `cut | sort | uniq` would generally be the quickest way
1037,"sounds like a good learning experience for you.  but don’t forget, instanciating that many objects will have an impact on your memory.  In addition, any kind of analysis done will be dependent on how python runs on your system; are you using pandas?"
1037,"<@Meg> yes, i am using pandas. but not in that context yet."
1037,"ok, because that would save time; it has a pretty bulletproof csv import functionality; so if you’re doing searching, analysis, etc, I’d look into that rather than rolling your own code"
1038,So I'm on a sortof low-urgency search for a dev-friendly widget kit in python that is available for linux.

1041,can you pass a class into a subclass and have it keep all previous properties?
1041,"sure, define class properties in `__init__`; unless the subclass overwrites them, you’ll have the superclass properties the same"
1041,like; I have a function that generates a superclass; is it possible to pass that superclass into the subclass instead or repeating the function and adding more elements?
1041,"uhh, generates a superclass?; I think you’re mixing up OOP basics.; in your init of the subclass, have it take in properties you want set.; superclass should have fields already set via its own init"
1041,"```
class A(object):
    ...
class B(A):
    ...
def make_A(data) -&gt; A:
    ....
def make_B(data):
    B(make_A(data), data[-1])
```"
1041,"in B, define an `__init__`; that will call `super(A, self).__init__()` with the required properties"
1041,I'm a bit confused; what does passing A into super do?; because the code I'm working on passes B into super (in the B class)
1041,"```class A(object):
    def __init__(self, a, b, c):
         self.a = a
         self.b = b
         self.c = c

class B(A):
    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d):
        super().__init(a, b, c)
        self.d = d
```; that’s for python3"
1041,"```
class B(A):
    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d):
        super(B, self).__init(a, b, c)
        self.d = d
```
that's the code I'm working with"
1041,"ok, so B is a subclass of A; and you’re already instanciating properties that B inherits from A; in addition, if you have a method defined in A that’s not replicated in B, its still accessible from B; eg, 

```class A(object):
    def some_func(self, t):  # do something

inst = B(...args)
inst.some_func('some_value')```

is perfectly valid; so, unless I’m missing something here, you already have everything you need"
1041,"right; I understand the OOP; but I'm trying to figure out the correct syntax; ```
class A(object):
    ...
class B(A):
    ...
def make_A(data) -&gt; A:
    return A(data[0], int(data[1]))
def make_B(data):
    # is this possible?
    B(make_A(data), data[-1])
```"
1041,what is make_A?
1041,just do `B(data)`
1041,"if you just want an A object, `make_A(data)` should instead just be `A(data)`"
1041,make_A parses a json and takes out the appropriate fields to put in the args
1041,"if you want a B object that inherits A, just do B(data) and in your B.__init__(), include whatever funky manipulations you want to the vars inherited from A; yah, so you probably want
```class B(A):
  def __init__(self, json):
    parse_my_json_and_do_things(self, json)```; there is a design pattern called a 'factory pattern' where functions return instances of objects, but I don't get the sense that is what you want in this case (I could be wrong)"
1041,"It's what I want, I think.
But I also think its what I can't have :stuck_out_tongue:; because this repo's factories are outside the classes"
1041,do you normally construct your objects from something other than json?
1041,"so I guess what I was asking is, can you pass the initliasations of a class to a subclass and have it inherit them
maybe something like
```
B(**make_a(data).variables, data[-1])
```"
1041,"factories are something loosely along the lines of
```class A:
  def __init__(self, initdata):

class B:
  def __init__(self, initdata):

def factory(type, data):
  if(type == 'A'):
    return A(data)
  elif(type == 'B'):
    return B(data)```"
1041,"I think this repo does both; <https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat/blob/master/fbchat/graphql.py#L106> if you're intrested; I'm adding a ""graphql_to_room"" function, where it's a copy of the above but instead with extra fields
and idk, it just felt wrong"
1041,"it looks more like it's accepting a GraphQL object and returning a Group object, but the GraphQL object is mostly just a blob of query data, so it could contain all sorts of things; so this is very similar to a factory, but it uses a bunch of functions rather than a class to determine which object to return; if you have a graphql blob of 'room' data, then adding a graphql_to_room function would make sense, just mimic what's in most of these other functions"
1041,"yeah; but instead of reapating code, could I get the graphql group function to do some of the work for me?"
1041,"it would depend on what's in your room data; down at the bottom of your file it defines a bunch of graphql types; there isn't one for a room, but if you add it, then you can query a room; if it is meaningfully related to a group, then you might get the group function to do some work for you"
1041,"well, a room is just a group with some extra things, so it inherits from it"
1041,"but assuming a room is not a group with additions, and a group is not a room with additions, it's probably most sensible to write a separate independent function; ah; then yah"
1041,"The problem is, I don't know *how* to get it to do some work for me :stuck_out_tongue:"
1041,what does your `class Room:` look like?
1041,not to be confused with `classroom`
1041,"and then what does your graphql room query look like?; I think it's likely that you'll not be able to reuse graphql_to_group because it's returning a Group object from a group query, and you're going to have to write a new query for a room object"
1041,<https://github.com/ekohilas/fbchat/blob/rooms/fbchat/graphql.py#L121>
1041,"and I don't know the ins and outs of how that all works, but it seems like the graphql queries don't exactly have inheritance"
1041,my idea is that I call the data on the graphql_room and then just unpack it's data into Room()?
1041,"yeah, I see why you might want to have some code reuse, and I suppose it's a little bit of a style question, but I think it will end up less readable"
1041,"at times, it can be a tough balancing act between competing priorities"
1042,"DRY, style, readability, etc"
1041,"you might get by with something like
```def graphql_to_room_or_group(rog):
    if rog.get('image') is None:
        rog['image'] = {}
    c_info = get_customization_info(rog)
    if(rog.get('thread_admins')):
      return Room(many args)
    else:  # not a room
      return Group(many args)```; but it's still going to be a lot of similar code duplicated; alternately, you could modify your Room.__init() to include a Group argument"
1041,isn't there a way to get the fields from a group and just put them into a room as **kwargs
1041,"```class Room(Group):
  def __init__(normal args, group=None):
    if group is not None:
      init_using_group_object()
    else:  # us normal args to construct superclass values
      init_using_normal_args()
    self.admits = admins
    # . . . etc with the other room-specific args```"
1043,wait what if I did
1041,"```
def graphql_to_room(room):
    return Room(
        room['thread_key']['thread_fbid'],
		**vars(graphql_to_group(room)),
        admins = set([node.get('id') for node in room.get('thread_admins')]),
        approval_mode = bool(room.get('approval_mode')),
        approval_requests = set([node.get('id') for node in room['thread_queue_metatdata'].get('approval_requests')),
        join_link = room['joinable_mode'].get('link'),
        privacy_mode = bool(room.get('privacy_mode')),
    )
```"
1041,"that would probably work too, I think; as long as you don't reuse any argument names in both classes or anything surprising like that"

1055,thanks <@Mirian>!; how do I add PyGitHub package in my project? is it just the same way as importing Flask?

1055,"ok, you have two solutions:
- use official github API
- scrape html to retrieve the information you need; I think the first one is easier; so you could just make direct http request or just use python wrapper that I mentioned"

1071,you'd have to cast that to multiple dicts; or make the value a list of values
1071,Essentially looping through the list and making your own dictionary object?
1071,I'd probably just use `collections.defaultdict`

1071,Can any one make a suggestion on how to programmatically test all the import statements in a package?
1071,test them how?
1071,"like look for import errors for example; My challenge is as follows; I have a package that relies on many very different 3rd party modules, in essence - we are building API wrappers, then implementing actions e.g. do something with the API wrapper; some are py2, some are py3; some of these packages don’t work in 2 and 3; so our module, which has all these classes which are wrappers around APIs; get’s picky depending on py2 or 3; so we inadvertently break our import statements; always at the worst time; so - I guess I’m asking how to catch this earlier with testing; I’m fully aware there is probably a better solution to my py2-py3 challenges, and we’ve talk about having a separate package/repo for py2 and py3 code, but I’d prefer not it if possible, but since we aren’t just a small module, we are a framework of integrations, it creates these import challenges that I’m admittedly not an expert on; <@Frieda> did help or make my question more ambigious"
1071,hmm. you couldn't just figure out which one break on which version and nest their imports under a check against `sys.version_info`?
1071,"<@Frieda> when I dict convert it what happened was I got a dict with the structure of `{""Keys"":[], ""Value"":[]}`"
1071,I’ll add that my module of class wrappers has an __init__.py that has try | except blocks
1071,non-cross-platform-compatible imports co-existing in a single code base is *_HARD_*
1071,That was bad english.... I had to convert it to a dict from a defaultdict because thats the dictionary I got back ^
1071,"<@Johnette> hmm, ok. i'm not sure i follow but if you got it working, great"
1071,<@Frieda> yea - that might be a good suggestion
1071,"<@Mohammed> you could set up tox to test your codebase w/ both py2 and py3, record the failures and start moving them into try/except or if blocks"
1071,"Yeah it works... just not beautiful, but oh well"
1071,"<@Johnette> I don't get, say, this line `keys  = dict(d)['Key']`; why convert `d` to a dict to get a key value? you could just do `keys = d['Key']`; `defaultdict`s are still dicts"
1071,"<@Frieda> you're right, corrected; ```def convertListToDict(tempList):
    # Convert the dict to default dictionary
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for x in tempList:
        for k, v in x.items():
            d[k].append(v)

1071,"`for i, key in enumerate(keys):`; i might even go further; `return {key: value[i] for i, key in enumerate(keys)}`; just eliminate `returnDict` altogether (also, what's up w/ the camelCase for variable names?)"
1071,camel case is how the company does it

1074,morning! in my class we were instructed to install python3 from terminal in order to run matplotlib and now I’m getting errors when I try to read files (UnicodeDecodeError: ‘ascii’ codec can’t decode byte 0xe2 in position 121: ordinal not in range(128))” I’m assuming it has something to do with utf-8. has anyone else had this issue?
1073,<@Chi> how did you open the file?
1074,"open(file_name, ‘r’)"
1074,"` with open(file_name, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:`; If you know that the encoding is UTF-8, of course."
1074,thanks! I’ll try that. is there any other reason why i’d be getting this error? is it a utf-8 error?
1074,"<@Chi>, according to <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open>"
1075,"&gt;encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale.getpreferredencoding() returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings."
1074,but it seems to be the file you’re opening doesn’t support UTF enccoding
1074,"It's encoding error. Looks like you are using windows, this only system that uses another encoding by default. So answer above will help. Also, you can explicitly use utf8 by calling
```
import sys  

reload(sys)  
sys.setdefaultencoding('utf8')
```"
1075,Can you install different python versions side by side?
1075,_sorta_

I’ve been reading that normal way to solve these kinds of problems is with threading. I don’t know much about advanced python topics yet so i ask does anybody care to show/tell me how structure to a program like that would look like.
Btw, the way i test my code now is by running two different consoles. Where in first console opencv process video and stores data to a txt file while matplotlib running in another console reading that txt file and plotting graphs simultaneously.

1079,Hi there guys! Hey i have a question. Why would i used docker while building a python app web-app? I've read some blogs and they advice to do so due the dependencies.

1079,"At first with docker  you will have same environment for all set up. This is main point because ever if you develop on ubuntu, have staging on ubuntu and production on ubuntu, they are differ and it's to hard for support.

p.s. you can read more in ""The Optimal Django Environment
Setup"" from Two Scoops of Django book."
1079,I see! You are right. Thanks a lot. Is there a good tutorial or book in docker you may recommend aditional to that one?; Thanks a lot!

I meant that every way i found to go about it was hacky and i'm really not sure about them. Haha. Thanks!"
1079,"Flask is a micro framework and you must know a lot things before can build good architecture with it. Django is more complex and have a lot of good practice inside, it definitely better for starting. And looks like today both of them is must have for python developer. But if you know python and know django, working with flask will be easy."
1079,That makes more sense :stuck_out_tongue: what had you found?
1079,"Ohhh okey okey. Thanks a lot! then it makes sense to get started with Django. Thanks a lot.; Actually was googling about using docker and virtualenv. But big disclaimer here is that, i know just enough about python and very little about setting up web apps, and i know nothing about Docker. And i really did not know were to start. I might need to study docker more and also the framework i'm going to use. For now i was googling if i should used virtualenv inside of my docker img in a python project. But again that might be too advance or idk yet. What do you recommend me to study first <@Vada>?"
1079,"In local development I would generally just use a virtualenv; when you are ready for prod get a Docker setup and make sure it works before pushing it to prod; virtuallenv and docker is unecessary; Docker in itself is - to an extent - it's own virtual environment, so adding virtualenv inside of docker just complicates things"
1079,"Thanks! well yeah i just read some blogs they were actually arguing due they thought it was a ""good practice"" and i was like... Hee nope.; So i rather ask"
1079,Yeah people who argue good practice without understanding why it is good practice need to be a bit of research
1079,"Yeah i'll make sure to always research first and ask. Thanks man. Peace out. it's 4 am over here :anguished: haha Have a good one.; And well before i leave. I'll leave this resource i found about learning docker in a more interactive way. It might be helpful for someone.

That was unexpected to me... Why not 'Aston Martin'? Or does max only work on integer values and is barfing on my query?"

1087,"<@Malorie> <https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/manipulating-pdfs-with-python/167>
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html>"
1087,"thanks <@Collette>, but I have managed to convert PDF to Text but the whole process of ocnverting invoice to data has been challenging. Anything on that front would be great :+1:"
1087,<@Malorie> every invoice will be different as many places don't format them the same. So it's going to have to be a unique solution to your invoices
1088,"Hi, I've been having real problems with importing my own packages in an aws lambda function, it would be great if i could get some pointers :slightly_smiling_face: 
My lambda handler is in a file called property_endpoint.py and the handler function is called api_get_properties,  I have this set up in the lambda console.

At the top of property_endpoint.py i import some extra things, like this
```import logging
from typing import Optional
from custom_exceptions.custom_exceptions import *
from property_package.mproperty import MProperty
from property_package.property_manager import PropertyManager```

But when i try to test the function it fails with the error `Unable to import module 'property_endpoint': cannot import name 'MProperty'`
mproperty.py is in a folder called property_package and i have an __init__.py in there. 
The top of that file look like this 
```import json
from property_package.property_manager import PropertyManager


class MProperty:```

It doesn't complain about the other one - custom_exceptions which i seem to be importing in the same way :confused:

Can anyone spot anything wrong here?"
1087,<@Vada> there is a library called invoice2data; but i am unable to correctly use it
1087,<@Malorie> you will have to provide more detail than thhat :slightly_smiling_face:
1087,"sure; so i used PDFMiner as the library depends on pdf2text which wasnt working for some reason; post using PDFMiner, i have been able to extract pdf info in text format; then i modified the library a little bit to accept text data; all that is fine; the library expects me to write a yaml template for a particular companys invoice; all invoice are matched based on keywords in yaml file; and information is extracted using regex in yaml file; i am attaching an example; but the parsing doesnt happen and it gives an error; above is yaml file created by me; similar to one expected by them; still parsing error shows up"
1089,"I am trying to write a lambda function, to update an ordered dict if len is not 0.; Its giving me a syntax error.; `eq_x = lambda g: g.update({'pnl':'NA'}) if (len(g) != 0) `"
1089,how do you use `eq_x`?; you also can't use if in a lambda; actually that is wrong you can do this; `a = lambda g: g.update({'pnl':'NA'}) if (len(g) != 0) else None`
1089,Thanks <@Vada>
1089,"If you're assigning a lambda to a variable right away, you'd better write a regular function"
1089,"<@Desire> while this does solve the issue, I agree with <@Collette>, lambdas are not for everyday constant use. You should define a function if possible - not a lambda."
1089,"<@Desire> a lambda is an anonymous function; what you’e doing here is essentially making a named function with a lambda, which is bypassing what it is intended for"

1095,"Not super familiar with tkinter so this might be off, but fill=X makes the widget as wide as its parent, which in this case is the header, but you are not also filling the header to be as wide as its parent (root).  If you wanted to label to take up the full space of the main frame you might also have to set fill=X for the header packing as well"

1095,<@Meg> you’re breaking my heart!
1095,What have you tried so far and where are you having trouble?
1095,Questions to consider: What data type is the user’s input in `input()`? What can you do with that data type and how can you produce the desired outcomes from that data type?
1097,"When I input the values.. example 3241515, it lists one by one and not in two.. I want it in twos i.e '32', '41'.. thanks; It's a list.. but I want the outcome grouped in twos"
1097,<@Carolina> it looks like the input is supposed to be comma separated numbers?
1097,It does that perfectly.. but I want to group the numbers in twos
1097,<@Carolina> does the problem say anything explicit about grouping in two or do you need to separate the string on the commas no matter how many digits each number is?  If you have the input as a string here is the documentation for all of the builtin string functions - <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods>; You should be able to use one of those functions to modify the string and convert it into a list

1102,sorry for spamming but still looking for a library that is good enough and simple enough to convert PDF invoices into tabular csv data. Please let me know if any suggestions
1102,"uh, <@Malorie> there were already a couple suggestions if you scroll up; <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1507816709000514>"
1102,<@Meg> already tried those
1102,"part of the problem with converting pdfs is you have to rely on heuristics; since in that file, each and every word there is simply composed of single characters with font, letter and possition information; PDFs don’t have the concept of structure that you can easily parse; unlike word/openoffice documents; so, to be honest, it is highly unlikely that you’ll find a solution to work for all your documents; in fact, I’d be surprised if there’s a better than 90% success rate, particularly giving the sheer variability of ways that PDF authoring software outputs the files"
1102,ive seen it accomplished with ocr  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytesseract>
1102,<@Meg> do you think there is any other way an invoice(a real physical paper invoice) be converted to a csv with all the data extracted
1102,only ever had a play once at reading pdf’s but it worked for me
1102,"there are applications that can help you read pdfs. mayan-edms is an electronic document management system and does ocr on any documents that it imports. you can then use its api to extract data.; <https://www.mayan-edms.com/>; btw, it’s a django app.; the web api uses DRF and swagger."
1102,"so, <@Malorie> there are some options available.  but ‘simple’ is definitely not part of them"
1102,dont need it super simple; but not so complex that i would rather write my own package; <@Johana>  so i need to figure out how to run electronic document management
1102,"ok so then you would need to deploy mayan-edms. you could use docker, a vps, an old laptop, or install it locally.; you give it a folder to watch and then you drop files in and it will suck them up and create a bunch of metadata you can read about the file.; i keep no paper documents at home. i use mayan-edms to manage all my documents."
1102,<@Johana> stuff like that look interesting but it seems so hard to maintain
1102,i run the server on an old laptop and haven’t looked at it since lol.
1102,hmm I should look into that (and buy a scanner :stuck_out_tongue: ); you use it only on a local network ?
1102,"it’s been like 2 years. the funny thing is when i first set it up i was building onto my home and when the contractors and i finished signing all the documents, I told them to hold on one minute. I dropped them in the scanner and mayan-edms automatically brought them up. I have a PC in the living room and brought up the docs for them to see. In other words, i was saying there is no way i’m losing the contract.; yea; you can search for any text and it will find the right doc."
1102,I'll look into it; just need to find a scanner that can upload to the cloud next; ouh they provide a docker image shouldn't be too hard to put in a VM then
1103,"I'm trying to setup API integrations tests using Runscope. Unfortunately, I need file upload for this. I've found info that ```The request editor does not support uploading files. However, some customers have been able to make file uploads work by pasting in a raw multipart-formatted body or unicode string input body into the request and making sure to include the applicable 'Content-type' header value with the correct boundaries. ``` (<https://www.runscope.com/support/kb/multipart-file-uploads>) I'm having trouble to construct this `raw multipart-formatted body`.; does anybody have an idea how it should look?"
1103,"<@Mirian> I would make a valid post to that api; with the browser dev tools open; see what data goes out, and how its formatted; that would give you clues how to do it in your integration tests"
1103,"that's what I'm trying to do, but the file i receive is somehow broken :stuck_out_tongue:"
1103,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1104,"Had never heard of mayan-edms, that does look nice. Might just set that up. <@Johana> is it difficult to set up? Looks like just a docker image."
1104,i installed it locally on an old laptop and it wasn’t difficult but I have deployed django apps before.; if you check the ecosystem you will see an ansible playbook i made.; with docker it should be a breeze.
1104,Is there an Android app where I can take a pic while I'm out on my phone and have it automatically put into the system?
1104,i have no idea.; its for documents so you could move the document from your phone to a folder that mayan is watching.; i don’t think you want to use it for photo management.
1104,"Not for photo management, but using phone as alternative to scanner while out. Say if I drop off a package at UPS and I want the receipt in the system."
1104,but if you took a photo of a document then i would do that; yea i know what you meant. i was just saying that you probably don’t want it watching for every photo.
1104,"Oh, yeah, not that. I was thinking an app that would take the photo and upload. Not scan all of my photos."
1104,i already use bittorrent sync so i would probably use that.; you could create a folder that bitttorrent sync is keeping up to date that mayan is watching.
1104,"Yeah, that would work."
1104,you can provide mayan multiple locations for it to watch.; in the background it is all celery tasks.; with a nice web frontend.; <@Meghan> i’m sure there has to be an app b/c it has a really nice web api.
1104,"Hi, I also have this error or similar 

` Caused by SSLError(SSLError(""bad handshake: SysCallError(-1, 'Unexpected EOF')"",),)) `"

1104,Sounds like it would beat the scansnap software. :wink: Thanks for the suggestions.

1105,"Also, why are you defining headers as an empty dict? You aren't using it either, or at least not in this snippet"
1105,The Question is should I be using payload or headers ?; we have to define the header fields using postman
1105,<@Malorie> Did you ever get the pdf situation figured out?  Our local Python meetup last night had a speaker talk about it.  (Looking for link)
1105,"That depends on what the server is expecting.; Headers would likely include things like api-keys, I believe. Where as the form content I think would typically be in payload.; Then you'll want to add headers=headers to your <http://requests.post|requests.post> call.; csv.DictReader seems to not support what I was hoping for. May have to extend it some day. Was thinking it would be nice to read a csv, determine if it is headered, if so use those, if not use specified. I could see where it could be error prone though."

1105,<@Meghan> you could determine yourself if the first raw are headers or not; and then use the reader you want for each

1115,Not sure ; Have you looked at pint?; <https://github.com/hgrecco/pint>
1114,i didnt see that one yet. i saw one called `measurement` but doesnt seem to work
1116,"<@Kenny> some suggestions:
When iterating through the keys of a dictionary, you can write
`for key in dict:`
instead of
`for key in dict.keys():`
If you are using both the key and the value in the loop you may want to consider
`for key, value in dict.items():`

`string[0] == '1'`
feels more natural than
`int(string[0]) == 1`

If you replace the first element of teens with 'ten', you can get simplify parse_two somewhat.

When you are using a list as a constant (like ones, teens, and tens), consider using a tuple instead.

I'd probably move the stringified_int line into the split function and create a new helper function for the building of the string itself. The reason I want to do this is to try to maintain a single level of abstraction in each of our functions.

I think it might be nicer if instead of creating a dictionary with 'hundred', 'thousand', and 'million' as keys, we put them in a list or tuple like you did for ones, teens, and tens.

Here's how it might look: <https://repl.it/McUI>.

1114,"Heya guys, struggling with Tkinter again... I have this:
```
class GUIManager(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.mainMenu()

    def mainMenu(self):
        root = Tk()

        l1 = Label(root, text = ""BibliotePy - Fall 2017"")
        b1 = Button(root, text = ""Agregar Alumno"", command = insertAlumno)

        l1.grid(row = 0)
        b1.grid(row = 1)
        root.mainloop()

    def insertAlumno(self):
        root = Tk()
        l1 = Label(root, text = ""Matrícula:"")
        l2 = Label(root, text = ""Nombre:"")
        l3 = Label(root, text = ""Telefono:"")
        e1 = Entry(root)
        e2 = Entry(root)
        e3 = Entry(root)

        # Grid Placing
        l1.grid(row = 0, sticky = E)

1121,"hello, this google api stt is some neat stuff but i am having trouble wrapping the example in some threading to keep it going. While a minute of speech to text is neat i would like to get hours of audio on a mic streamed to a text file or database. It seems like links are okay so ill paste the original here as it is from git... 

<https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/master/speech/cloud-client/transcribe_streaming_mic.py>

To this i added a line and get some long term transcription to happen but eventually things bomb out or crash. 
def main():
  threading.Timer(35.0, main).start()

I believe i need to setup some services to run the mic to a stream and pass that to another thread that is keeping the google api connection open while another takes the response from google and writes to a text file/db.... So far getting everything together is beyond me and i am hopeful some folks have time/experience to help me piece something together.  (thanks)"
1121,"<@Shakita> google’s API library is not thread safe, so you cannot use threads for your solution"
1121,"oh... didn't even think to check on that; and it prolly says in some red line on the top of everything i have been reading **not thread safe**; thinking... 

so i would like to keep the pyadio stream buffering and pass it to google api which will drop out every 30 to 60 seconds. I suppose i could have a loop that handles a graceful restart of the api connection... now instead of trying to do that inside a thread i just need to figure out that graceful restart while pulling in the mic buffer"

1123,<@Patty> i think (based on logging outputting the thread info) that the example from google for python and the api is using threading.
1123,"does anyone have experience wanting to run 2 event loops ~_~; well, I don't really want but yea...; python-xlib has its own event loop; but I want to run a bunch of other stuff in an asyncio loop; it uses locks; <https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/blob/eb3f4b70671afa09cdd38b43d7cb5e38d92f63a7/Xlib/protocol/display.py#L157>; with the blocking nature I think it makes sense that I need a thread"

1124,"<@Jesusa> I’ve seen two asycio event loops run in separate threads. If you’re not sharing data between them it’s even easier, but otherwise you may have to implement your own mutexes. I haven’t done it myself and only tried multiple event loops in node"
1124,i think i am getting the looping to happen in an acceptable manner... had to add a check on time at the start of streaming to gcloud and then close if i was gt 45 seconds later.
1124,So then I’m assuming you’re using the google cloud client?; It’s still not thread safe. They are working on moving the back end libraries to be thread safe

1124,Anyone know how to set a python environment on an offline server with no pip install. I can only transfer files and exeutables through a cloud storage . Is it a matter of using the tar.gz files for each package or can it be done using anaconda?
1124,pip can install local packages if you supply the path; I'm not sure it's possible to package a whole environment easily
1124,<@Ronald> are you on linux?
1124,Windows; <@Collette> on Windows
1124,"Then yeah, download wheels for windows on another machine, copy them into your offline machine and do `pip install wheels/*`"

1124,"ok, the whole issue is you have the virtualenv in the `/root` folder; _bad_; so, it’s really locked down with permissions; normally what I do is use the default user folder, install the virtualenv there in `/home/user_name/.virtualenv/project/....`; and point to that instead"
1124,I got you.
1124,"so, the clue for that was `EACCESS`; because that’s a kernel issue; and says you have some permission issues; then the path to the virtualenvs was the next big clue"
1125,Looking for a suggestion for a good geocoding lib in python. Need to be able to convert addresses into IPs. Thinking about Google Maps APIs but wondering if worth using a standard python solution first. Geopy looked good until I realised it is now unmaintained. Anyone used anything else?
1126,Does anyone have any idea how I could accomplish logging of specific calls and stderr to the same filehandler where stdout are specific log-calls whereas stderr are generic script crashes? I can't get the errors to print to the file correctly...
1126,Why not use the `logging` module ?
1126,"I am, it's driving me nuts that I can't configure it correctly"
1126,can you share your config ? :slightly_smiling_face:
1126,"To be honest, what I'm force to now is actually sending all logs to stdout as a downstream program captures the stdout, but I can't get the stderr to be picked up as well...; ```
        root_log = logging.getLogger('')
        root_log.setLevel(<http://logging.INFO|logging.INFO>)
        formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

        fh = logging.FileHandler('stdout.log')
        fh.setLevel(<http://logging.INFO|logging.INFO>)
        fh.setFormatter(formatter)
        root_log.addHandler(fh)

        sh = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
        sh.setLevel(<http://logging.INFO|logging.INFO>)
        sh.setFormatter(formatter)
        root_log.addHandler(sh)
```; tbh, the filehandler could be ignored"
1126,I thought you wanted to log to a file ?
1126,"As mentioned, a downstream program captures the stdout and writes to file, I was a bit unclear"
1126,or do you need it to be read by a downstream program ?
1126,It's not by choice I should point out
1126,I'm sorry but just to be clear. Would logging everything directly to a file be ok ?
1126,It would not in this case
1126,ok; I'm not sure you can redirect exception output to something else than stderr. You could either read from stdout and stderr in your downstream program or do a big `try` `Except` and `LOG.exception`
1126,I did look at redirecting stderr to stdout but it looked and felt wrong. The downstream program is unfortunately not something I can modify so i'm sort of stuck with this venture
1126,I would do a big try except then; or maybe someone else as a better idea
1126,"so I'm confused, you don't want to redirect, but you want your stdout and stderr to go to a file?"
1126,"Currently, all logging is sent to stdout. In the event of a script crash, i need to error to also go to stdout. I'm guessing I need to redirect here, but what I found so far looked really hacky, but I suppose that's the way to do it.; Although, it might not be possible at all without some giant try/except as already mentioned?"
1126,do you only want error to go to stdout when a script crash occurs?
1126,"if it's only when your script crash you could do 
```
try:
  main()
Except:
  ...
```; it doesn't feel that hackish to me"
1126,I agree with <@Ciera>
1126,"I suppose you're right. It just looks like a lot of repeating try/except due to it being a `click` initiated script with increasing numbers of subcommands, where the context class created initiates the logging. Might just be due to my stupid setup but i'll give it a go. Thanks!"
1126,I'm not entirely familiar with click but maybe you can set it up before calling your subcommands ?; or passing the subcommand as an arg to the try/except func
1126,"Ye, should be doable but then I'd have to break the logging out of the context class; I'll play around with it a bit and see where I end up. Thanks a lot for the input"
1126,"I've started doing this on scripts to make sure any unhandled exception is in the logs. That way I don't have to rely on users for anything other than emailing me the log. (Haven't automated log uploads yet.)

```
try:
  main()
except Exception:
  log.exception()
```"
1127,Why not use opbeat?
1127,Never heard of it. What is it?
1126,<@Meghan> I'm attempting this now but it seems a bit weird with click and its subcommands
1127,"I've not used click, but I would assume you run a function that dispatches to other functions, right?"
1127,Pretty much yes
1127,Then wrap that call with the try/except.
1126,"I'm trying to at the top level, but as I said, click seems to be acting weird. Won't return the exception from the subcommand; Where the error should be, I instead get an empty message"
1127,You don't get the exception at all then?
1126,"It enters the except clause, but my `except Exception as e` gives an empty e"
1127,What does log.exception() get?
1127,"Wait, I might be the one who effed up..."
1126,"Ah crap, I've gotta run... Wife's gonna murder me if i'm late. Thanks for the input though! I've got some ideas for tomorrow"
1127,"<@Meghan>: it's a service that basically does what you are describing, I use it for projects all the time to get better error reporting"
1127,I'll take a look. Thanks!
1127,Best practices question: It seems that the programmer would have to know that  generator co-routine yields 1 (or other integer) iteration each call but that the generator could be anywhere... is there some sort of good practice/convention for referencing co-routines call on a generator?
1128,"<@Seema> You can wrap the generator function in another function, which creates the coroutine, calls next() on it, then returns it, so you don't have to manually call next() after instantiation. The internal generator could be defined anywhere and instantiated inside the wrapper. Is that what you mean?"
1128,"<@Rosamond> Here's an example of a call to a coroutine where the code is right next to the coroutine.  I'm assuming the coroutine could be in any module/namespace.  Is that true?
```def fibonacci_co():
    current = 0
    next = 1

    while True:
        current, next = next, next + current
        yield current

for n in fibonacci_co():
    if n &gt; 1000:
        break

    print(n, end=', ')```; if fibonacci_co or any co-routine can be somewhere else, how would programmer/user know that it would have to be iterated."
1128,"I would still call that a generator function since it's only yielding results, a coroutine can take arguments for each iteration and usually has an opening `yield` in the definition.; That's moreso what I mean. Then _coroutine could be defined anywhere. If in another namespace, just import it"
1128,"I'm under the impression that coroutines are just a special type of generator, is that right?"
1128,"Yeah, maybe more meaningful to say a generator is half of a coroutine :slightly_smiling_face:"
1128,"and the coroutine has a next and a generator object and ""advances"" each yield.  My question is that if this was imported and the function was consumed, how do they know it's a co-routine other than print(""Created coroutine."") and print(f""_coroutine({data})"")"
1128,"<@Seema>, hope that the dev provides doc strings"
1128,<@Winnifred> I think you get the gist of my question :wink:
1128,"That, and if you dir(coroutine()) it should have a send member."
1128,"wow, ouch, umm... okay, thanks for tip; will it have a next() or is that only in the generator object?"
1128,Yeah. The agony and ecstacy of dynamic typing ha
1128,Time to poke and prod and learn
1128,Looks like there's an 'isgeneratorfunction()' in the inspect module; to take out the guesswork :slightly_smiling_face:
1128,Lol
1128,"As far as next().. to my knowledge send() replaces it, however there may be cases where you send a single item and yield multiple outputs; So next may be used there?"

1132,Is running `wget` using `subprocess` ill-adviced for any particular reason? `urllib` just seems like a hassle and `requests` don't work with ftp; I keep finding old answers that do not work anymore for `urllib` and I can't make decent sense of the documentation...
1132,I don't know but maybe there is a FTP module? 
1132,I think `urllib` uses `ftplib` internally
1132,Otherwise subprocess is not ill adviced in my opinion for simple stuff where complete program already exist

1133,"Hello guys
So I have an X matrix of dimension (762, 64) and y matrix of dimension (762,)
When I try to use np.scatter(X, y) I get an error that X and y must be of the same size
Any ideas?"
1133,They aren’t the same size?
1133,Apparently not; Im not sure what can I do in this case; Im trying to build a binary classifier with 64 features; So my data consists of 64 columns and 762 rows; I'm not sure why do X and y have to be of the same size
1133,"No I was saying that they aren’t the same size, hence the error "
1133,Oh I'm aware of that I just don't know how to tackle that problem or why should they be of the same size
1133,"What is the second dimension of y?; If there isn’t, then it’s a 1d vector and a 2d array, and they can’t be plotted together "
1133,"Its kind of like
```
[ 8.  9.  8.  8.  9.  8.  9.  9.  9.  9.  9.  9.  8.  8.  9.  8.  8.  9.
  8.  9.  8.  9.  9.  9.  9.  8. 9.  9.  9.]
```; So I guess I have to turn that into  [[8][9].. etc] ?"
1133,You need to have coordinate pairs. You can't simply plot the value x=5 without a corresponding y-value.
1133,The simple way to say how to fix it is make it both the same type and size
1133,"Sure, but if every row(consisting of 64 features) has 1 y then it can never be of the same size no?; So the only thing I can get is 762, 64 for X and 762,1 for y; Heres how Im making the data; ```def preprocessing(file_name):
    # Generate numpy array from csv file
    csv = np.genfromtxt (file_name, delimiter="","")
    
    # Initialize matrices
    X = []
    y = []
    
    # Filter data
    for i in range(len(csv)):
        if csv[i][64] == 8 or csv[i][64] == 9:
            X.append(csv[i][:64])
            y.append([csv[i][64]])
            
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)```"
1133,"Yes, you’re not constructing them with the same size. ; Think about it this way: how would you even plot that?"
1133,I agree I can't plot that; So I guess I have to add columns? columns of zeroes?
1133,I don’t know what value to give them as I don’t know what the data is or what you’re trying to accomplish 
1133,"Im just trying to make a binary classifier (8 or 9 instead of 1 -1) using linear regression; I just have numbers as data; randomly generated; I have 65 columns, the first 64 are the features and the last one is the output (8 or 9)"
1134,Why scatterplot?
1133,"I was just splitting my training sets incorrectly, everything worked fine with i used splitting with sklearn <@Patty> <@Scot>; Thank you!"
1135,hey is it possible to pass a variable within a dictionary ?
1135,"not sure what you mean, but you can pass a dictionary"
1135,for example taking raw input and passing in to the value of a dictionary
1135,"```adict = {}
myresult = myfunc(adict)```
is valid"
1135,"```user = raw_input('please enter username: ')
     passw = raw_input('please enter password: ')

payload = {""username"": 'user',
           ""password"": 'pass',
           ""Content-Type"":""application/json"",
}```"
1135,if you put `'` you create the string `user` but if you don't put them you reference the variable user
1135,"yah, you want the vars, not the strings, so remove the quotes around the varnames"
1135,Thanks for that I'll give it a try
1136,"Hey folks. I'm a relative noob, but I've been doing some self learning for a while and I'm looking to break into a technical role.

I'm talking with a person about a position that requires ""strong Python and SQL skills"". I'm most experienced with Python, but on the main project I worked on that would have required SQL (a flask web app) , I ended up using SQLAlchemy instead of writing SQL statements. I have a basic understanding of SQL though, and could figure out more complex queries with some extra time.; Say they see my resume, decide to call me, and ask about my SQL skills. Would it be reasonable for me to say something like, ""Well, I have a basic foundation in SQL, but perhaps to handle some more complex queries I'd set up and use SQLAlchemy""? Or would I get laughed off the phone?"
1136,"I wouldn't mention ORM until they ask; actually don't tell them anything and only answer questions they ask you, that's a safe bet"
1136,did you use sqlalchemy orm or the core?
1136,orm
1136,start learning the core. it will not be that hard of a jump knowing the ORM. the ORM is built on the core which at its heart is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for SQL that is written in python. The syntax is really similar to what SQL statements look like. When you feel comfortable writing SQL core queries then you can answer confidently that maybe you don’t have a lot of experience writing raw sql b/c you like to use tools that take care of parameter binding and reduce risks of sql injection. You can also say with confidence you understand what makes up SQL and don’t think it would be difficult to learn since you know sqlalchemy core and orm.
1136,and to add a nice resource to practice …; <http://sqlzoo.net/>
1136,SQLAlchemy is a very useful abstraction layer on top of the database. I’m sort of the opposite. I came into SQLAlchemy from the database world so I had already nearly written applications in raw SQL. That’s one of the reasons I found Python. I needed more power!; you can also dump the sqlalchemy queries and study them.; i gotz all sorts of sqlalchemy tricks in here: <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/db.py>; I’ve done plenty of interviews where i may not have been an expert on many parts of the job but if i was able to display with confidence my capability to adapt and learn then that made all the difference.
1136,"Awesome! Thanks <@Johana> for those ideas and <@Winnifred> for that resource.; Yeah, that's what I'm banking on here. I have a foundation to work from at least, but depending on how long it takes from resume submission to phone interview, I just wanted to have _something_ to say"
1136,"yea, the safe answer is typically, “i like to use tools that take care of parameter binding and reduce risks of sql injection, like sqlalchemy which i’ve done …. yada yada .”"
1137,dbapi? :stuck_out_tongue:
1136,sqlalchemy is a cool toolkit as it doesn’t hide too much of the database away. in other ecosystems a lot of devs don’t even know what the db schema looks like.; cough* .NET
1136,h i b e r n a t e; I love SQLA for this. Once I saw that m2m tables are not abstracted away I fell for Alchemy hard..
1136,"yea, when i was instantly talking to the database and being productive i was sold. i gotta admit though it changes your thinking. when you come strictly from the db world you think about data as sets. You don’t think about working at the individual row level and iterating. Then when you get into programming it flips your mindset.; the last thing you want is a cursor b/c it’s slow."
1137,<@Kenny> You could also review some SQL interview questions and do some SQL problems on Hacker Rank or something. It's unlikely anything will get much deeper than what you could get out of playing around with that stuff for a bit
1136,"That may not change your self-assessment of SQL skillz, nor should it, but chances are they will ask a handful of things that are easily covered by those sorts of resources"
1138,I've yet to use SQL Alchemy. Is an ORM really that much better than just writing SQL?
1138,"for about 80-90% of the stuff you do, yeah; but there are cases where raw sql is better; especially with optimized queries and such.  in addition, some ORMs can create lots of duplicate queries during the compilation process"
1138,What is the advantage of it?
1138,ease of use; makes quite a few things easier when executing queries
1138,Interesting. May have to give it a try some time. Since we've switched to DreamFactory I'm usually just calling a stored procedure through a rest api.
1138,then you gotta write that query…
1138,Yes. Most of them are easy though.
1138,"I mean, I wouldn’t want to write this query out by hand"
1138,"Most of our data isn't all that relational. Lots of small projects with hundreds of thousands of records, but relatively flat.; Haha, nah, no interest in writing that."
1138,"with that, its basically fifteen lines in Django ORM,"
1138,how many records is that ?
1138,me or <@Meghan>?
1138,"Sorry, you, should have specified :slightly_smiling_face:"
1138,"hmm, small database but with plenty of tables; so, for this particular query, it aggregates over about 8k rows"
1138,"ah, gotcha"
1138,so I basically made a model manager in django; created a metrics method to aggregate; and I pass in extra fields in a dict with the evaluation to occur
1138,i’d like to write that just to reminisce on my T-SQL and PL/SQL days
1138,masochist :smile:
1138,Should the ORM create the schema or is it better to adapt to an existing one?
1138,you can do both; django will let you create models from an existing schema; or you can create it from your model definition
1138,"<@Meg>, do you cache a lot of your queries?"
1138,yes; and profile; `django-silk` really comes in handy; but caching is a little tricky because you basically have to try to strike a happy medium between cache lifetime and new data
1138,"ah, nice, I need to figure out efficient caching"
1138,what are you using?
1138,"no current projects right now, but I was running into problems with ORMs and large queries out of a redshift  instance; but I think this is because I hadn’t transformed the data enough to get the data to a point where it requires a simple query"
1139,We've been using django-cachlot for a while and haven't had any real problems with it: <https://github.com/BertrandBordage/django-cachalot>; Perhaps that doesn't sound like a resounding endorsement lol but what I mean is it does what it says and we haven't had any painful gotchas
1138,hahaha; how can you ask for more?
1138,would definitely give it a :thumbsup:
1140,Hi all - simple question. How can I print out the contents of a generator object?
1139,"```&lt;flask_restplus.reqparse.RequestParser object at 0x1132b3ed0&gt;```; Iterating through does not work, nor does coercing to a string."
1138,"sure, you just have to consume it first"
1139,`next(obj)` ?
1138,In what manner <@Frieda>
1139,generally convert to a list or some similar thing; list(generator)
1138,"if it really is a generator object, you should be able to consume it to a list or a string or whatever (list is probably safest) and then print that"
1138,Assuming of course it doesn't generate infinitely. I think list(generator) would be bad if that were the case. :wink:
1138,"Yeah I tried to consume to list, and that did not work. Perhaps not truly a generator object?"
1138,look it up in the source and see what's actually being returned? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1139,```TypeError: 'RequestParser' object is not iterable```
1138,"yeah, I fired that off a bit prematurely, sorry"
1138,"generators are permitted to never halt; or, finish, whatever you want to call it; you could print out the next() item from a generator, or do it a few times; SO suggests one possible alternative:
```g1 = gen()
[g1.next() for i in range(10)]```"
1138,<@Amie> what made you think its a generator to begin with?
1138,^^; <https://github.com/noirbizarre/flask-restplus/blob/master/flask_restplus/reqparse.py#L291>; it doesn’t look like a generator to me
1138,May want to take a look at the usage here: <http://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parsing.html#>
1138,Turns out it is not
1140,I am having trouble accessing the contents of RequestParser essentially
1140,Can you share your code?
1140,"Sure; ```  @api.expect(post_parser)

  post_parser.add_argument('slack_channels', type=str, action='append')```; The exception is being caught at the line where the value of ‘args’ is assigned; My main objective is to identify the contents of post_parser; You are absolutely right"
1138,"yeah i was re-reading there, but it doesnt look like that reference will ahve anything"
1140,"Also, why are you defining the class under the root route of the API?"
1140,"I’m not, just the paste order :slightly_smiling_face:; Here is updated:

1138,What does the `__init__` of `PostListAPI` look like?; or is it just inheriting from `Resource`?
1138,Inheriting
1140,post_parser is an assigned variable based on the output of a method
1140,"<@Amie>, I think you need to pass args into your `post(self)` call.; Actually, you’re trying to do that through the decorator.; Did you see the example <@Patty> posted?

1142,ok that will be difficult. These files are going to run on AWS ec2

1142,ok I am not going to explain why ... exactly this happened. But the gist is that pip installed libraries don't compile well under amazon linux.

1147,"haha, like i said. he left an impression on me and now i try to take the patient approach."
1147,Nice!
1147,i guess i was really amazed that he would even take the time to help.
1147,It does say a lot about the guy willing to help a total beginner on it
1147,"he’s a pretty interesting guy. i tried to ask him a lot of questions about his decisions in flask whenever i did get a chance to see him. He always gave these very simple yet cryptic replies. One time I asked kinda a silly question b/c i was a newb but impressed with the flexibility of Flask. I asked him what I could read, learn, or do to write applications that were extensible and flexible. He wrote back, “Don’t write software that isn’t flexible.” At the time I was confused and like “oh … ok”… but now I know what he meant and in the end it was a pretty good answer."
1147,Lol nice :joy:
1147,"I feel like that should be followed with a ""But don't write software that is too flexible"""
1147,lol; which can be a shortcoming for flask sometimes; he later wrote me back saying he sometimes has trouble articulating his thoughts (i was very surprised by that b/c his writing is good) and that I should ensure that my stuff has a lot of “hooks”.; i spent a lot of time looking up what hooks were lol.
1147,"""Don't write software that isn't flexible"" is itself a pretty flexible answer."
1147,I like the hooks line though
1147,i may have used the word extensible and not flexible but whatevs; it was a number of years ago.
1147,I don't often think of my code in terms of events but it's probably worth putting myself in that mindset more
1147,they're interchangeable when you're not being terribly specific about your meaning
1147,"Oh boy this is funky, I need to coerce csv values to match the type in the database (to abstract away some ETL stuff), is there a better way than:

```
    def same_data(self, csv_row: Dict[str, str],
                  db_record: namedtuple) -&gt; bool:
        for csv_name, col_name in self.csv_to_col.items():
            col_val = db_record._asdict()[col_name]
            csv_val = type(col_val)(csv_row[csv_name])  # coerce
            if col_val != csv_val:
                return False
        return True
```

where `col_name` is the database column name, `csv_name` is the csv column name, `db_record` is a named tuple from psycopg2, and `csv_row` is a dict from a csv.DictReader row"
1148,TIL: `type( )( )` pattern
1148,"I am not sure I recommend it yet, it's really the only reliable way I could think of doing the coercion to do the comparisons"
1148,"had a need to coerce values from an Excel import, into Django models, and I used a mapping of the columns to the type, not as concise as your example but explicit"
1148,"I thought about that as an option too - but I like the idea of the database being the ""source of truth"" for this project since it's just a data pipeline (I want it to be low maintenance). But that is a good option too"
1148,do table columns and csv headers have same name or are they similar?
1148,"Not always, but I just expanded it to default to the same if no `csv_to_col` is set on the class; Because that is serving as a mapping of csv row to the db row"
1148,"yeah, I actually like this. I just noticed you’re using a namedtuple."
1148,Yep! Psycopg2 has a NamedTupleCursor; also a dictcursor
1148,it made a lot more sense in my case b/c with Django as the intermediary the model class can still be the source of truth - I later created a module that uses the ModelForm so it can validate and coerce as necessary as well
1148,"Yeah, that totally makes sense!"
1148,"yeah, the mapping aspect is covered here and I think that’s the important part —  ~I wonder what the internals of the coercion are~"
1148,"If it's a complex class it probably wont work, but it's all database primitives (Decimal, float, int, string) pretty much"
1148,"I don't see anything wrong with using `type` like you have here - you need to read that line a bit carefully to see what's going on, but it strikes me as a reasonable strategy"
1148,"And they all have constructors like `int('1')` or `str('foobar')`; Thanks for the feedback on it, I will add a little comment to make sure it's clear when I come back in two weeks and :facepalm: about some bad assumption I made :joy:"
1149,"So I was reading <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/715417/converting-from-a-string-to-boolean-in-python> and I was wondering, what IS the standard? I wrote my own str_to_bool function and just reuse that, but it feels like there should be an easy built-in that I'm missing"
1149,"<@Marcelina> I'm not sure that I get the question, so to clarify, you're trying to evaluate string `""False""` to `False` and `""True""` to `True` or what?"
1149,"Correct; `bool(""False"") = True`"
1149,"write your own map, and a function to parse it correctly"
1149,Which is what I did - I'm asking what's convention
1149,"Depends on what you're doing, IMO. In cases where you are accepting user input directly from a shell or something, then I would do the approach `input_value.lower() in ['yes', 'y', 'true', '1', ...]`; Otherwise I'd just make sure the thing gives you the right `type`; I don't believe there is a different convention than that"
1149,Parsing a payload from a JSON object with users who go back and forth between using a bool correctly in a JSON payload vs sending it as a string; But cool; Sounds good; I just wasn't sure if there was a built-in I was missing
1149,"If you are defining the contract for the API, only accept bools; Or give a 400; No reason they can't do the work on the front end since a bool is valid in the JSON spec"
1150,"hello, people!
i am starting to use `pytest` for a project and trying to get my head around the best and correct design patterns of using fixtures.
specifically, i have a couple of questions:
1. if i want to have a fixture that can serve both a single test at function scope and a bunch of tests in a class/module scope (determined by command line option at runtime) - shall i create 2 fixtures that provide basically the same dependency (a Class instance, that prepares and exposes a resource I'm testing) but each decorated with different scope? what is the best way to tackle this?
2. is it common practice to use the request.config as a place to store shared data that can be accessed by different fixtures? what is the better way?

thanks for any help in advance! :slightly_smiling_face:
p.s.
are you familiar with any open source projects that leverage pytest extensively - for more than just unit tests, with complex fixtures that uses other fixtures, etc... so one could learn from?"
1150,"<@Arlean> 1. Why? Do you have an example?
2. I'd use a shared session-scoped fixture instead"
1151,"I am using the open() function to append a file however, this function creates a new file if it does not exist. How do I disable this part. I only want to append existing files and not create new ones if they aren't available. Any help would be much appreciated"
1151,check if a file exists first; then open it
1151,use `os.path.isfile()`; for checking existence
1151,"or `os.path.exists()`  

they basically do the same thing here"
1151,When would i use `exist` over `isfile` ?; Works for directories as well I see
1151,"correct; so, its a bit of duplicate functionality; `isfile` would work for a path to a file, `isdir` is for a path to a directory; `exists` covers both, with some potential issues of permissions"
1151,"I'd rather go with ```
try:
    with open(filename, 'r+') as f:
        f.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to the end of the file
        # proceed with reading/writing
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass
```; `os.path.exists` and `os.path.isfile` are both error-prone to race conditions"
1151,"Seems a bit of an overkill for most of my purposes, but good to know..."
1151,"```
import os
if os.path.exists(filename):
    with open(filename, 'a+') as f:
        # proceed with reading/writing
```
is only 2 lines shorter. The correct version doesn't seem to be a huge overkill to me :slightly_smiling_face:"
1151,Enlighten a dummy: Any penalty to speed using `seek`? My files are in the 10-100Gb sizes from time to time
1151,"You need to be at the end of the file if you want to append, so it's doing nothing that wouldn't already be done"
1151,"<@Scot> CPython calls `lseek` with `whence=SEEK_END`
<https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/_io/fileio.c#L908>"
1151,I suspect I may have misunderstood the intent of the `seek` way of doing it from the get-go. Understood it as a general better replacement to using `os.path.isfile`
1151,"No, `seek` is a way to move the current file pointer over the file as you wish"
1152,thank you all for your help; my code is up and running :slightly_smiling_face:
1151,"<@Collette> - thanks for suggestions. have some followup questions though:
1. example? I want a fixture that sets up some Server and then test it - either by providing a fresh Server instance to every test (function scope) or by reusing the same Server for a bunch of tests (class scope) - the Server setting up fixture is the same - the usage is different. 
my idea was to have:
```
@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def server_for_single_test():
   return Server()

@pytest.fixture(scope='class')
def server_for_tests_in_class():
    return Server()
```
but this feels rather redundant, no?

2. regarding the pytest shared session fixture suggestion...
wouldn't this mean i'd need to have every fixture define it in it's args?
```
def fixture_a(request, shared_state, ...):
    pass
```
no way to avoid this? feels like autouse wouldn't fit here as i need access to the shared_state instance somehow"
1151,"<@Arlean> 
1. Yeah, I got what you meant. But _why_ do you need this? What problem you're trying to solve with that?
2. Yes. Just like you'll need `request` fixture requested in every single test"
1151,"<@Collette> 
it is not really a problem, more a constraint.
* the Server I'm testing takes a while to bring up and configure, so I would like to minimize this time during tests and have multiple tests run against same Server
* on the other hand, some tests are more destructive than others and might affect other tests if they run against the same Server - so I would like to have them run separately
* in addition, would like to have the option to decide on which way to run from command line flag and not for example forcing all tests be in classes even if they are classes of single test

hope this makes sense; oh, and for 2. there is a workaround:
```
import pytest
...
def some_test_or_fixture(request):  
    assert pytest.config == request.config
```
so i do not *have* to pass request just for some shared data"
1151,"Alright. I'd put these two kinds of tests into separate folders, with different fixtures, and run them like `pytest tests/shared` and `pytest tests/destructive`; To me a cli switch is not enough when doing destructive things. I think you have to be explicit about what you're doing, and it's better to minimize the possibility of running a wrong suite; Anyway, I'd go with two different fixtures"
1151,"ok, I'm glad I was in the same basic direction with defining different fixtures for this

1153,you can use a heapq; as long as you treat it like a stack
1153,"```from operator import itemgetter
sorted_list = sorted(list_of_dicts, key = itemgetter('SnapshotCreateTime))

1153,<@Meg> but he always wants it sorted

1153,"the current project I'm working on uses an Enum to store a set of default colours; however this was a bad design decision because colours can also be customised; and so now I've run into that issue where a Colour Enum was tried to be created but couldn't because it wasn't pre-defined; is ther esome way to define a custom element in an enum to hold any colour?; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; from enum import Enum
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Color(Enum):

...     GREEN = 2
...     BLUE = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; Color(RED)
Color.RED
&gt;&gt;&gt; Color(BLACK)
Color.CUSTOM"
1153,where CUSTOM can be dynamically changed? or just that any non-existant key maps to a pre-existing CUSTOM?; if the first I don't think that's possible with Enum
1153,"wait let me edit that; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; from enum import Enum
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Color(Enum):

4
```; <@Antionette>"
1153,How many customs do you want to be able to have?
1153,for every possible colour
1153,So the code using this then goes something like `if Color.RED: color_value = '#ff0000'`
1156,?
1153,"more correclty the code is
```
class ThreadColor(Enum):

    MESSENGER_BLUE = ''
    VIKING = '#44bec7'
    GOLDEN_POPPY = '#ffc300'
    RADICAL_RED = '#fa3c4c'

And tries to make a color given a user string
```
return ThreadColor( '#44bec7')
```; but now I need it to be able to work for any hex string"
1156,Sounds like maybe instead of an enum you'd be better with a dictionary
1153,"Yes, absolutely should be a dictionary, but that depends on how much code needs rewritten."
1153,"not much, but it just wouldn't be backwards compatible"

1153,Someone's told me that Sum Types are what should be used for this but They're not really a thing in python

1153,"<@Collette> yeah I'd agree
I just wanted to see if there was anything possible to oncsider first"
1153,"Even if that is technically possible, I don't see how that would fit the mental model of enums"
1153,So why would a dictionary make more sense?
1153,Did you look at the SO post I shared? It can be done with the aenum library.; Because you can add to a dictionary as you go and can address it by key.
1153,"but I don't really need to address it by key
It's just a unified structure to store a colour
which could just be a string instead.; <@Meghan> I did look at the link, What wouldn't make sense is what the name should be when you add a new one in"
1153,"Should a custom given, non-existent color code result in it being stored under a unique ID for further use alongside other new custom colors?"
1153,<@Winnie> it sounds like you need a mapping between color names and some sort of values. A dictionary can be used to implement such mapping very easy
1153,"I came to Python from C/C++ so I tend to shy away from assigning real meaning to the value of an enum. Whether or not that is idiomatic in python I'm not sure, but I feel like it's a behavior that's unlikely to backfire on me. Dictionaries are meant to map from one piece of info to another which sounds more appropriate for your situation. Enums work best when they are compared with each other but not really used as substitute numbers or substitute strings. That's not to say it's the only way to use them, but it seems the most resilient way"
1153,"Yeah, once the value matters it should be a dict."
1153,"well the thing is that there's only ever one reference to a colour name in the code
I think an enum was used just because they thought an enum would suit the job"
1153,"and it did at the time, but now you want to extend it and it doesn't fit as well as it used to"
1153,actually
1153,"and you can still make it work if you really want, but it will involve a lot of branching depending on whether your enum is custom or not"
1153,an enum kinda fits because the user should only be able to provide the given values in the enum
1153,why not reverse the key:value to value:key and run a dict lookup?
1153,<@Winnie> don't you think that contradicts to what you've said earlier?
1153,disclaimer: it's 2am here
1153,"I'm confused, if the user only gets to use the provided values, why do you need custom at all?"
1153,"okay I think it might be easier to give the longer story
so I'm working on the fbchat module, which interfaces with messenger
messenger would allow you to configure colours given a set ammount
but there was a point where you could just make a get request for any colour
so now I have a facebook chat with a black chat bubble
now fbchat attempts to read in the colour to its pre-defined enum
but now, messenger has made it such that you can no longer make a get request with any colour; so the module needs to be able to accept any colour from a chat
but we need to tell users that only these colours in this enum can be actually sent; so what I'm thinking is to re-factor such that on return of a colour, a string is given instead of a ThreadColor object, but on sending, a user must give a ThreadColor object"
1153,"so it gets the color options from messenger, and offers just those to the user?"
1153,yes
1157,Are the colors documented?
1153,yes
1153,would it work to build a dict from the messenger data and then just catch a KeyError if the user gives something not in the dict?
1153,<https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/master/api.html#fbchat.models.ThreadColor>
1153,You really like enums
1153,This isn't my project; I'm just contributing :stuck_out_tongue:
1153,This project really likes enums :slightly_smiling_face:
1153,yeah...; <@Sirena> I think it makes more sense to give the user a datastructure that they have to use as opposed to let them send whatever they want but just fail them when they do it wrong
1153,Might be able to build off of something like this:; if you can somehow find way to get val be a color instead of just the int
1153,<@Antionette> you'd just pass the string instead
1153,well I meant an instance of `Color`; right now the newly added values are different from the values created when the Enum is instantiated
1153,howso
1153,ie in the example that gets printed Color(2) is Color.RED but Color(3) is Custom3 rather than Color.Custom3; it points to just the name rather than a `Color` with the correct name
1153,right; it's probably better to use extend_enum in that case
1153,extend_enum?

1159,"hello, is possible to explicitly import `*.pyi` files with containing definitions without having actual `*py` file nearby? As an example, TypeScript use such technique to define interfaces that are used only on compilation time, but not available at runtime."
1159,Does anyone have any good resources for pytest for a newbie trying to wrap my head around it
1159,"pytest docs? they have a ""Getting started"" section"
1159,Thanks <@Suellen> I'll give it a try; seems like a steep learning curve for a newbie
1159,"I mean, most of the stuff that you would normally use is on the first 10-20 pages"
1159,Yea seems little intimidating I'll give it a try basically I would want to run series of queries against an API . which would return the status bunch of nodes; which would send the data to a database; to display within a web browser; is pytest overkill for such a task ?
1159,pytest will work great for that
1159,"<@Kellye> what would you do with the .pyi files after you imported them? In most senses compilation time _is_ runtime, and .pyi is mostly just used for static analysis AFAIK"
1160,"from PEP484:
&gt;&gt;&gt;While stub files are syntactically valid Python modules, they use the .pyi extension to make it possible to maintain stub files in the same directory as the corresponding real module. This also reinforces the notion that no runtime behavior should be expected of stub files."
1160,"<@Sirena> 
that's true, that's why I need them, I want to use custom types from *.pyi files as contracts to function calls. For example defining custom model like
``` class MyModel:
   myProperty:int
```
then I could use it as parameter type in function. I assume mypy can detect that anonymous object follow contract of that virtual type from *.pyi file. like:
`def func(value:MyModel) ...`
then calling it like
`func({""myProperty"":1});`"
1160,"I'm not an expert on this, but my understanding is that .pyi does not enforce a contract like that during run time; if you want to enforce it, you need
```def func(arg1):
  if not isinstance(arg1, classname):
    raise TypeError('received incorrect type in argument 1')```; or something like that; also, I'm not sure I follow your example, if you want the property of MyModel, just use it
```def func(value: int): . . .```
```func(MyModel.myProperty)```; and while it may not be easy or possible to redesign, typically if you find yourself doing typechecks in python, it's possible and recommended to design them out; none of this is hard and fast, just kind of a best practice when you aren't constrained by other factors"
1160,"that's was just an example, basically you end up having 5-10+ props and nested objects. As I referred before, TypeScript makes it possible - you can define an 'interface' that will just specify data layout, but will be cut out after static type checks.; I'm just trying to figure out whether it's possible in python, there's not much information on pyi files; basically resources recommends you to have .pyi files in same structure as your source code"
1160,"I'm not terribly familiar with TypeScript, maybe someone else can field your question on that, but most python interfaces rely on behaviors/methods rather than on types"

1161,"try printing dir_path before the insert line, is it actually the path you are expecting?"
1161,yeah something like that; I tried that but that it returns errors on the imports that live in crunchy_json
1161,"Yeah, Mark, it is likely that `crunchy_json` does absolute imports; You may have to do the `pip install -e path/to/my/version` route; That installs it in ""editable"" mode (kind of like a symlink) and as you make changes in the lib it will reflect in the other environment you import it into; (note you will need to re-import it)"
1161,"Okay thanks, ill look into that..; i’ve tried from resources.lib import crunchy_json and it looks like it does a little more but then it errors on a include that includes a sub part crunchy_json.

1162,well it was a shortened example :slightly_smiling_face:

1162,"<https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#rounding-modes>; I think it would be hard to call one ""normal"", they're all used in different circumstances"
1162,"yeah, none of them are ""if the decimal ends in 0 to 4, round down, else round up"" scenarios; the default is more 0 to 4 round down, 6 to 9 round up, a tie rounds to an even number"
1162,that would be ROUND_HALF_EVEN
1162,Round to nearest with ties going to nearest even integer; nearest even integer? why??
1162,What do you mean? Why use that methodology or why is it called that?
1162,nvm I guess I just want ROUND_HALF_UP

Process would be something like:
Script prompts user for site number
Site number is defined as a variable
Script connects to M$SQL and uses the site number variable within the query
Script can then either create new python variables directly from SQL query results *or* return SQL query results to a list or tuple for reading/manipulation. 

I have looked into pymssql and pypyodbc and either I am too noob to catch onto something that's already in my face, or I don't see variables as a possible value to include in a SQL query. 

Any pointer or help are greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
1183,Looks like pymssql exposes the commonly-used Python DB-API: <http://pymssql.org/en/stable/pymssql_examples.html#basic-features-strict-db-api-compliance>; It looks like pypyodbc is also DB-API compliant. I'd be surprised if there's any commonly-used Python database adapters that aren't.

1184,"you have a machine backup, right?  :stuck_out_tongue:"
1184,Yup.
1184,yeah the best way would be to reinstall. Otherwise you might have trouble in the future that will be really hard to debug
1184,yeah I’d restore from your last backup
1184,and while restoring an article on virtualenv is needed :stuck_out_tongue:
1184,"<@Ciera> I’ll probably restore to previous backup, <@Junita> Thank you."
1184,"np.  and yeah, this sort of stuff happens to lots of people starting out"
1184,<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>
1184,"Thank you everyone, for helping me understand. <@Collette> <@Meg> <@Winnie> <@Junita> <@Ciera> <@Cynthia>"
1184,pipenv is really nice :ok_hand:
1185,I've read through the linked documentation and I cannot seem to decipher how to use the python defined variable within the query. Their examples just don't lay it out in a way that is making it click for me.
1185,"I need to move a lot of files from a network drive to 2 separate external USB 2 drives in a Citrix environment (no idea on the hardware specs for USB Bus) I'm thinking that I can utilize multithreading or multiprocessing to speed this up... If using a pool of 2, what's the proper python way to assign a drive letter to each worker so they are writing to each drive at the same time?"
1185,"is this on linux or windows?; because if you’re on linux, use rsync with parallel; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24058544/speed-up-rsync-with-simultaneous-concurrent-file-transfers>"
1185,"Sadly, windows.; Citrix is locked down so I don't have access to powershell or cmd, just the shutil in python"
1185,"they’re not making it easy on you, huh?; <http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp>; would you be able to install that?"
1185,I don't know. I can definitely try.  I have to keep track of each file as they like to reboot citrix at any point
1185,"ok, are they adding these requirements just out of fun to make your life difficult? :smile:"
1185,Using SQLite as i have to cherrypick what files didn't complete the last time they attempted this with File Explorer
1185,:facepalm:
1185,"Well, they attempted this weeks ago... and only 30% of everything copied.; so I had to compare what was in Azure against what was on disk and make a new manifest to copy; you can see how much fun this is :slightly_smiling_face:"
1185,"yeah, I can; well, you probably could do something with shutils and multi-processing; but in all in all, using something like deltacopy or something similar would be better for you; no development time required for you; and a production-ready application with years worth of work and bugfixes"
1185,"Yeah, but it doesn't address the cherry picking of files though which stinks otherwise, this would be a great solution"
1185,why do you need to cherry pick?; why not restart from zero
1185,because those files are already in azure; everything is going to azure from an on-prem solution
1185,"I’m still not sure; you want to copy everything from azure to local; last time this was tried, about 30% of the transfer succeeded"
1185,"out of 100 files in nested folders, i may only need 20 as the other 80 already exist in azure."
1185,"unless I'm misunderstanding your meaning gisdev, deltacopy will do cherry picking"
1185,we have to ship these hard drives to microsoft to load; the drives were wiped when they were returned
1185,sorry if I wasn’t able to help much; hope you can figure something out with your internal company policies
1185,Let's simplify it... How would you assign a drive letter to a worker pool of 2 :slightly_smiling_face:; so that process 1 gets drive X and process 2 gets drive Y
1186,"i've a dictionary that has index as key,

the list needs to be sorted in descending order based on the value present in the dict
which i was able to do.
```
sorted(curr_co, key=lambda value: node_value_dict[value], reverse=True)
```
but in case of equal values, i need to sort it according to their indices in ascending order

currently i'm doing it by looping over the sorted list and then comparing value again side by side maintaining two pointers.
Can you please suggest some elegant way of doing this."
1186,<@Marquita> I'm under the impression that sorted is stable and that you could first sort reversed on value then on key achieving both desired outcomes
1186,<@Seema> You are correct about sorted being stable - <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sort-stability-and-complex-sorts>; That documentation also goes on to use that fact to give an example of sorting based on multiple attributes
1186,"I was there recently and I ended up trying all four variations and still was barely confident I understood how it was doing it.  I was doing list of tuples just like the example.  Eventually, though, success. :slightly_smiling_face:"
1186,Yeah its definitely an interesting/unique way of looking at multiple sorting params
1186,New to Python. Wanted to know if anyone knows of good beginner to advanced programs I can play around with. I found some but though to ask here. Any help/links are much appreciated.
1186,"Arsenii, do you have a thing you would like to try or some sort of project or program you want to make?"
1186,"<@Jamaal>, as <@Seema> is suggesting, project based learning is one of the better known approaches to learning a language. While working on a project, it is then useful to see how others approached similar problems and understand the differences in design"
1186,I took some time off between jobs to learn the language from scratch. I am currently using Python the Hard Way tutorials and wanted to supplement with some coding exercises. Here is what I found to start: <https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/>
1186,And those are all great for learning the semantics of the language
1186,ideally I would like to start small so I can understand the basics and build out on that foundation.
1186,Do you have specific goals in mind for what larger projects you are trying to take on?
1186,:slightly_smiling_face: yes I would like to build a A.I.
1186,"haha, I too would like to get into that. It's some pretty thick stuff though"
1186,I know; but with open source and a great community I think it is possible
1186,how much programming have you done?; Nothing is impossible if you put the work in
1186,not much; :slightly_smiling_face:; yes
1186,"I would suggest the No Starch Press books for getting started, they helped me a lot when I was getting going just 2 or 3 years ago; <https://www.nostarch.com/catalog/python> anything that looks interesting in here"
1186,great thank you <@Lory>
1186,kinda on the topic of building an AI and being a beginner: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIofV14c0tc>
1186,you can find free pdf's of them online
1186,I was just about to say I know of a good place for free pdfs
1186,the above video is not only for data scientist. the presenter talks about hacking yourself into a community in general.; it is very interesting.
1186,thank you <@Johana>
1186,"circumventing the usual steps of getting a degree, etc."
1186,"I'm not a big fan of that style (the five mini-programs one), it's very procedural.  Getting into the functions is where the joy is at imho.  Have you seen <https://py.checkio.org/> ?   The first exercise is poorly lableled elementary and it is unfortunately the requirement to get everything else unlocked, but it is a great place to learn more functional programming.  If you go ca-razy on it, they hope to leverage it into a career via <http://hired.com|hired.com>"
1186,i think they need to adjust their meta tags.
1186,part of the reason I want to understand more is we have a data science arm in my start up that I want to understand more.; and help out
1186,"<@Jamaal> You'll still want to pick a project/goal, ML is pretty broad, it's a technique more than a goal, so you'll want to do something you are interested in."
1186,`Checkio is a code game coders` doesn’t make sense
1186,<@Mallie> <http://daily.jobs|daily.jobs>
1186,"Also, The Coding Rainbow on youtube has a couple videos on developing an AI through JavaScript, the concepts can be easily ported to a python code base though. He's kind of a weird dude and doesn't always use the best practices. BUT he does a good job of explaining conceptually what's going on <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&amp;list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh>; The Coding Train*** I forgot he changed his name"
1186,If any of those provide nice data to use that is a big plus; If you are just using it for learning sake
1186,<@Mallie> we are in the process of getting data; so it's a good time to learn
1186,"if data science is interesting, I suggest taking a csv file and trying to manipulate it, maybe pull down a favorite sport or some geeky data about something you like and see if you can do some 5 number summary on it, see if you can order it, see if you can create new data, etc"
1186,so are we touting coding challenges as a way to learn programming faster or something?; i don’t think challenges have helped me learn a language as much as getting practice using concepts I already know and learning to use them in new ways.
1186,yes to supplement <@Johana>
1186,k; just making sure.
1186,"Depends, is your goal getting a job or being successful in that job? :smile:"
1186,"agreed, but there's a step before that where being able to even perform the basics is difficult"
1186,both <@Mallie>
1186,"Well challenges are basically interview practice, real projects are growth/experience, just keep that in mind"
1186,by the way thank you guys for being so open about it
1186,"yeah, I think there is a little difficulty getting started when you don't know what you don't know. helps to set some intermediate goals by having a project to work towards"
1186,I will thanks <@Mallie>
1186,whether they are 'coding challenges' or something else
1186,"That was not to imply one is not important btw, that's just kinda the reality of being able to do thing off-the-cuff/on-demand and broader picture; You'll certainly get asked about and be expected to describe projects, but likely not re-design it on the fly (most of the time :wink: )"
1186,:slightly_smiling_face: thanks
1186,"arsenii, much of data science is munging data, being able to find, replace, filter, transform data is a great tool to have if that's your interest."
1186,yes; it is; and understanding it as well

1188,Hello. Anybody here who has GoCD knowledge? I would like to get some help
1188,"assuming you’re talking about CI, check out <#C22DMH61M|devops>; FYI, might help to be a little more verbose, since I hadn’t heard of that till I looked it up"
1188,Thanks <@Meg>; I had intended to be “verbose” when explaining my problem :slightly_smiling_face:
1188,:smile:
1189,How do people feel about functional testing in addition to unit testing? Think it is overkill or not needed until certain points in a project?
1189,It's not overkill
1189,"there was a pycon panel about this with heavyweights and they will all in support, for slightly different reasons"
1190,"it was more about linting and humans than about functional testing though, very nuanced"
1189,"I prefer _writing_ unit tests b/c they're faster and easier to write, but just like a child prefers cookies to roasted broccoli (mmm delicious!) it doesn't mean it's sufficient"
1190,can anyone suggest popular IoC (inversion of control) package to use? PyPI provides too much to choose from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=dependency+injection&amp;submit=search>
1190,"Is there any real reason to using an ORM (like sqlalchamy) besides not having to write queries yourself? I personally have my own module for storing/executing/returning queries and at times it runs faster than the ORM, obviously because a human is better at constructing complex queries than a computer is (for now). So besides the obvious, are there other reasons you guys find yourselves using one?"
1190,"how maintainable is your own module :slightly_smiling_face:; scalable? works with schema changes without tinkering?; I mean, sure there are reasons to use raw sql over an ORM; but those should be limited to areas where the optimization is needed; not as a first reaction"
1190,"<@Lory> I generally try to avoid ORMs since I think they are often the wrong approach to the general problem of database abstraction, so you're not alone, but I'm sure you'll get _plenty_ of arguments for why you should use one"
1190,"<@Issac> how maintainable is that, though?"
1190,"for just myself and a few friends that use it, it's fairly easy. Just deifne your boiler plate queries and then call them through a few defined methods that give me all results or one result or whatever and have them preformatted to how I like my data structured; schema changes require manual intervention lol"
1190,"<@Meg> you mean not using an ORM?  I would tend to argue that the types of abstractions that ORMs introduce is increasing the complexity of the code and introduces more maintenance overhead than not using one, although like anything else in development you can do it badly and incur a lot of pain"
1190,"sorry no, my small module"
1190,"<@Meg> There's a middle ground between ORM and raw SQL (like <http://knexjs.org/> for node, not sure of a good example in python) that helps with maintainability while being a more simple abstraction"
1190,"django ORM works similar, I think; as well as sqlalchemy, in which you can write raw sql and it’ll handle it for you"
1190,"My biggest gripe is that it feels awkward to use one in the code, and that's just because of a lack of familiarity with using ORM's, So I figured what does it _really_ matter if I just use my own"
1190,"and for your own projects, thats fine; if you’re working on non-super critical performance in a team, then I would definitely make you justify the case of not using an ORM if I were interviewing you"
1190,"and it just that, I'm trying to get into free lance web application design so I'm slowly building my own modules for things I feel are bloated like ORM's, Login modules, etc..."
1190,sqlalchemy was started because the author was tired of hibernate’s bloatedness :slightly_smiling_face:
1190,"Like most things you just need to be aware of the trade-offs, the once that have been mentioned incl. Imagine working on a large team or needing lots of people to be able to access and modify things in the database (like will happen many many times with a fairly complex dynamic website) and trusting all developers to get the SQL correct. That's a maintainability nightmare."
1190,bingo; that there is my primary argument against; especially if the actual performance difference is a few percents overall in load and query time
1190,"And you may find that you only need to do one or two db calls, which is great, and you may find that as you maintain more and more projects all that ""custom"" SQL boilerplate wastes time."
1190,"furthermore, as a freelance web dev, <@Lory>, you have to consider the ‘when’ case, when another developer takes over your project; how easy is it for the other person/team to get up and running with your setup?"
1190,i think you should decide what is most important to you when working with the ORM or the core.; ORM is business objects and Core is more schema-centric.; if you want to be down in the weeds and know your db schema you should use core. if you want to deal with things like business objects use the ORM.
1190,"I would agree with <@Meg> there, freelancing does come with the burden of not just doing the most technically right thing, but the most expected thing since a lot of what your client is paying for is something that can serve as a baseline for future devs to continue to modify and support the application"
1190,it depends on the level of abstraction you want. I’ve used both quite extensively.; i try to avoid raw sql as much as possible.
1190,"speaking for myself, at my current place, I had to figure out what the hell the previous dev was thinking when he put together the query structure for a very important part of the API.  He just had python joining strings to construct the query, and execute with raw sql, using cursors, etc.

When I moved it over to using django ORM, the actual query time went down about 50 milliseconds per query… without indexes"
1190,much better to use a DSL like sqalchemy core.
1190,"I think ORMs are problematic because they unnecessarily couple several parts of the system that should be decoupled (datatype definitions, constraint solving, persistence, and transport of network attached data).  My personal experience is that in projects of any size they often end up causing more harm than good, and architecturally I dislike the types of applications that tend to have them central to the application"
1190,not all ORMs are created equal tho.; sqlalchemy’s orm is significantly better than others i’ve used.; for one it uses the unit of work pattern so you aren’t going to commit anything until it all works.
1190,"<@Issac> no argument there with your points about complexity and coupling.  But is that really significant, though?; and personally, in my projects, I’ve had to drop to raw sql a handful of times when performance was required"
1190,<http://aosabook.org/en/sqlalchemy.html>
1190,"I really don’t like writing SQL, and only do it when the profiling shows there will be a distinct difference; and that’s after optimizing the db structure, adding indexes, and doing everything to reduce the number of queries executed"
1190,"<@Meg> obviously I think it's significant, I don't expect everyone would agree with my personal weight of the tradeoffs though."
1190,"oh, certainly. Like I said, there’s valid arguments for and against; though, am wondering"
1190,"I tend to think that, performance aside, anything that decouples the system and facilitates me reasoning algebraically about my application with a minimum of leaky abstractions and corner cases is a huge win to me; but hey, I'm coming from haskell :laughing:"
1190,"well, time for me to head out, got a meetup to get to; nice talking with you, <@Issac> :slightly_smiling_face:"
1190,have a good meetup
1190,"thanks!  its put on by ESRI, and I know a few of the map/geo people going to be there"
1191,"Hey all, in Python 2.7, using `unittest.assertRaisesRegexp`, how come it’s giving me false regex matching failures for my own exception classes, but working fine with something like `ValueError`?; in the fail message it says:
&gt; AssertionError: “Failed to find the needed file(s) matching 00000000-000000-xxxxxxxx” does not match “Failed to find the needed file(s) matching 00000000-000000-xxxxxxxx”; When… those… are… identical… ?; It’s not some weird text encoding comparison that’s failing, is it?; Actually nevermind, it’s something else going wrong somewhere, if I change the code to raise a ValueError instead I still get the same matching fail"
1191,"Can you post the code that is failing?; If you have that exact string as the regex to match, you might need to escape the parens"
1192,"Hi guys, i’m writing a module to read/write/edit files on target fpt server, I know python has supported ftp lib. But i just curious if I look for the folder files (in the server) and try doing nasty stuff with the file like normal file, and the ftp server can detect change, update it back to the ftp user? I dont mind write the module in the same server with fpt, but are there any drawback if I go down this path?"
1192,What book do you guys recommend for a new python programmer that doesn't have programming experience. 
1192,Think Python 2e.; A friend of mine was also new to programming and he found it really helpful.
1192,"I'd have to go with <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/> , partly because the book is free to read (the physical book still costs), partly because it's accessible and partly because it doesn't presume.  It lacks real apps and takes awhile to get going but it's free and if they put down the book for something better, no harm done."
1192,The automate book still assumes you know basic programming concepts
1192,"the book does?  I thought it was based off the site which has things like
```You run the interactive shell by launching IDLE, which you installed with Python in the introduction. On Windows, open the Start menu, select All Programs ▸ Python 3.3, and then select IDLE (Python GUI). On OS X, select Applications ▸ MacPython 3.3 ▸ IDLE. On Ubuntu, open a new Terminal window and enter idle3.

A window with the &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt should appear; that’s the interactive shell. Enter 2 + 2 at the prompt to have Python do some simple math.


&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 2
4
The IDLE window should now show some text like this:

Type ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license()"" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 2
4```"
1193,<@Bruno> it doesn't the first part is all about basic concept :slightly_smiling_face:
1194,"`file(s)` is a regex that matches the string `files`, but not the string `file(s)`.; `assertRaisesRegexp` kinda sucks if you just want to match literal strings, sadly. To do that reliably, you need something like:
```
assertRaisesRegexp(exc, r'^{}$'.format(re.escape(expected_message)), …)
```; Sometimes, it's easier to use the context manager instead:
```
with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
    do_something()
e = cm.exception
&lt;do assertions on e&gt;
```"
1195,"Hey all, Is there a way for me to be able to run a cleanup script when I use `deactivate` on my python envs? I set some environment variables in my `.env` that I would like to clear away when I'm done working on something."
1195,"I’m trying to write an application that will search for indentation made with 4 spaces or with tabs, and replace them with 2 spaces. In have found 2 options for doing this:  
1. with fileinput, but this seems to have some limitations and I don’t know if it can do what I want it to do
2. with re regular expressions
which one would you recommend?"
1194,"<@Ines> I don't think that regex will help you since the structure of languages is more based off of context sensitive grammars. Regular expressions (finite automata) aren't powerful enough to represent the evaluate same set of strings as CSG's. (I could be wrong though, it's been years since I've done anything with computer science theory)."
1195,"<@Ines> Oh wait, what am I talking about. I totally missed your question (It's well past my bedtime). 

- get lines from your input file
- count how many spaces there are before the first character in the line"
1195,"would you please re-read my question :slightly_smiling_face: I know what I have to do, I just don’t know the easiest(/best) way to do it in python :slightly_smiling_face:"
1195,"- divide that count by four, then multiply that by two.
- take the substring that's all text, prepend ((space_count / 4) * 2)"
1195,"I’d probably recommend simply using a regex, then you don’t have to count; replacing four spaces or a tab with two spaces will work, regardless of how many multiples of four or tabs (or even a mix) there is"
1195,"<@Junita> thank you! I was thinking about fileinput as that will save me the trouble of opening the file, reading its content, fix the indentation, write back the content, close the file"
1195,"also note it might just be easier to do this with a tool like sed, unless you want to do use this as a learning exercise"
1195,"I think it will confuse the regex. Assume the dashes are spaces, and the underscores are the replacement. Such that `----` gets evaluated to `_`.

What happens with `--------` (eight spaces)? Does it get evaluated like `_----` then `__`? Or does something weird happen like `-_---` where the regex wont capture the other 4 spaces."
1195,"but to be honest, I haven’t found how to search for patterns using line.replace… this is why I switched to re"
1195,I say screw it and divide space count by two and the append the text.
1195,learning exercise and also I want a script that can be used independently
1195,"Forsure!; One sec, I'm whipping something up"
1195,&gt; I think it will confuse the regex.; I think regexes are not easily confused %); They are a powerful tool with maths 'n stuff backing them up
1195,"<@Kayce> it’s pretty easy, you make a match (such as `^(\s{4}|\t)`) and then feed it into `re.sub`, which can handle multiple replaces: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub>"
1195,exactly this; I even started to test it out :slightly_smiling_face:
1195,"there might need to be a tweak around the anchor to the beginning of the line, but yeah, that’s the general approach; Especially if this is meant to be a learning exercise, might as well learn.  :slightly_smiling_face:; If it’s not meant to be a learning exercise, I’d say using an external tool will be faster, more accurate"
1195,Regex evaluated an input of 8 spaces to 6; =/ I'm no bueno with regex
1195,probably worth practicing with them to get better than instead of avoiding them.  :stuck_out_tongue:
1195,True! I don't come across them terribly often though! Any sharp regex knowledge quickly fades after a week.
1195,"<@Ines> also, it goes without saying, backup these files first.  :stuck_out_tongue:"
1195,"<@Junita> :)))))))) of course it goes without saying. although, replace would have made the backup automatically. also, I don’t necessary agree that an external tool would be faster, unless your talking faster from a processing point of view. this “app” I’m writing has the ability to search the project structure recursively and finds all files I want to modify by looking at their extensions (which are parametrised so I can specify whatever extension I want), and reformats all files according to my needs, which are also parametrised. you will have the chance to take a look at the end result on github after I finish it. and if you’re asking yourself where did the need came from, all our JavaScript files have been indented with 4 spaces, but we want to switch to the recommended standard of 2 spaces :slightly_smiling_face:"
1195,most editors/ides have something to do that project wide; how would replace have done that automatically though?  Maybe I’m misunderstanding what you said you had done already?
1195,"to be honest, I didn’t find how to do it in my IDE of choice, and neither using external plugins or other apps, either for my IDE or for a different editor. I’m pretty sure that there might be tools and probably even an implicit way of doing it in my IDE, it just wasn’t easy to find so I took this as a good opportunity to write a small python app :slightly_smiling_face: I think you understood what I’m trying to do, taking into consideration your commentaries. I can switch to a different standard in my IDE, it just won’t replace the existing format :slightly_smiling_face:; <@Junita> thanks again"
1195,"np, and yeah doesn’t hurt to do it as a learning exercise!"
1196,"Can someone explain to me what virtual envs are?
How/why are they used? And maybe how I can/should start using them?"
1196,"<@Omar> virtualenvs are segregated python installations you use for each individual project you run.; This way each project gets it's own python installation (whichever version you want), it's own environmental variables and, most importantly, it's own third part packages.; It avoids mixing dependencies between projects so you don't have any clashes; also means that you have a defined set of dependencies for each project which can be easily translated into a requirements.txt file; the easiest way to use it (in my opinion) is by installing this libary: <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation>; (for mac and linux)"
1197,"any idea why this `print(letter, end='')` is throwing up a syntax error? I have another line `print('_', end='')` that isnt.; this is the block ```for letter in secret_word:

1197,&gt;  CPython 2.7.10; Of course `print()` is invalid syntax on python 2
1197,oh damn missed that; god spot; <@Amee> you installed the wrong python version :slightly_smiling_face:
1197,i havent had the issue before using `print()` only on this app
1197,<@Amee> either you had `from __future__ import print_function` or you have been actually using `python3`
1197,or you didn't use arguments
1197,yep

1197,so this is a good question… i have 2.7.1 installed; but also install the latest via homebrew

1197,how do i make everything point to the latest version; i followed this
1197,you don’t want to do that; leave system python alone; use a virtualenv :slightly_smiling_face:

1197,"so is a python2 flake8, not a python3"
1197,i used easy_install to install pip

1197,"ok ill give that a go :smile:; stange though as i have never ran into this issue before, but ill try and remove flake from 2.7.1; thanks guys; following these steps are the correct way to install the latest version of python though right?; then id just use python3 and pip3  ?; <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/#install3-osx>"

1200,Does anyone know of some good reading material on python's setup tools? I feel like most of the articles I've come across are just a waste of time
1200,how so?  what’s lacking?
1200,"I feel like all the tutorials/articles/etc have read as if the person they're trying to teach already knows the stuff and I haven't been able to fully pull out all the pieces that make it work. Like specifically how to structure your package with an __init__.py and why you can leave it empty and why you may or may not want to. How to do simple local pip installs of your project if you're not interested in publishing on pypi, like in the case of a webapp; I feel like they are all hyper focused on going from project to pypi and these are the steps to get there without ever really explaining anything. By ""they"" I just mean various articles I've found by googling from trusted sources to random people writing blog posts"
1200,"Just now seeing these responses (sorry). 
<@Seema> Ok, was the panel from this year? I would love to check it out
<@Ronni> I agree unit tests are easier to write, and I actually want functional tests more for a documentation for the devs to know the workflow more than anything. I was really shocked when I left a project for a year to come back to it and instantly understand where I left off and what needs to be done because of functional tests with user story comments"
1200,What pieces are you looking for <@Lory>?; It kinda sounds like structuring python projects.
1201,Hey Guys  Any suggestion of a python library for mysql dB querying for beginner ?
1200,I know this is a little bit of a lengthy video but it is by :dabeaz: and it enlightened me to python packages and imports (not pypi). <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oTh1CXRaQ0>
1201,Hey Guys  Any suggestion of a python library for mysql dB querying for beginner ?
1200,I’m a bit partial to using sqlalchemy. it isn’t touted as the best library for beginners but learning it will definitely pay dividends.; it’s the defacto library for working with relational databases in python
1201,hey <@Johana> Thanks for the suggestion what your thoughts on django ?
1200,I like django. i believe you can use the orm if you like separately from the web application.
1200,the function is to make queries to a monitoring DB
1200,How familiar are you with SQL?
1200,from 1 to 10 I would say 3; maybe 4

1200,ok so if you were to write raw sql queries you would have to learn SQL.; so that would probably take the most time/effort.; if you were to try and use the sqlalchemy orm you could work with the database in a more object oriented manner.; which is a bit easier for beginners.; :point_up: this snippet will show you how you can reflect the database and start querying it.
1200,ok sounds good not that I don't mind putting the time in and learning to write sql queries
1200,"yea, i’m not saying you do. i’m thinking in perspective of time usage.; you would need to alter the connection string and it will work for mysql.; that’s the beauty of using something like sqlalchemy. it has abstracted the nuances of the different databases.; if you want to switch to postgres you can pretty much just change the connection string."
1200,yea I know exactly what you mean by the time efficiency
1200,"and all your queries will work. you can’t say that with raw sql.; that’s the power of sqlalchemy. you never have to worry about if you can talk to a database. it pretty much covers all the major relational databases out there.; I can add some explanation to the snippet.; essentially what is happening is in sqlalchemy you need an `engine`.; this engine is the connection to the DBAPI.; it generates sql queries for you.; The ORM is built on top of that.; You need the `session` which is bound to the `engine` in order to use the ORM.; you could use the engine alone. or you can use the session. if you decide to use the session you have to use SQLAlchemy’s Expression language which looks like SQL, `select([Users.c.name]).where(Users.c.name == 'mike')`; that’s the equivalent of
```
SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name = 'mike'
```; The ORM provides a more declarative way to talk to the database.; You essentially create a class that represents the table in your database."
1200,and just to get this right the session interacts with the ORM ?
1200,"I’m doing that above by reflecting the db.; yes!; the session is like a recorder. You can add things to it (insert) you can take things away(delete) etc.; If you want to add a user you can do something like this:
```
user = User(name='mike)
session.add(user)
session.commit()
```"
1200,So i guess session maybe the way to go then again I wouldnt mind learning the engine as well but it might be more of a learning curve
1200,"so now you can work with the database as you would any other python object.; i would learn the core after the ORM.; SQLAlchemy is stand-alone so you can integrate it into anything.; a CLI app you got it, a web app you goit.; here is a flask app that uses sqlalchemy. <https://gist.github.com/m1yag1/d354ab69398ab84f72f9e0b8c712ffb6>"
1200,nice thats pretty damn cool !
1200,check out lines 171-87; that’s a class model of the table in the database.; it’s faster if you model your database this way. you may have to do that. or you can reflect the db like in my first example.; sqlacodegen is a library that can generate a models.py file for you by reflecting the database.; i’ve successfully ported applications using this very feature from microsoft sql server to postgresql.
1200,if you don't mind me asking ```sqlacodegen is a library that can generate a models.py file for you by reflecting the database ?```
1200,typically an ORM or database library needs to “know” how the database schema looks like.
1200,why would I have to reflect my database ? in this this instance
1200,it does this via reflection.
1202,ohh !
1200,it’s just an easy way to start working with the database.
1200,:+1:
1200,i use it a lot to do adhoc queries.; i do not recommend it for applications with a lot of db tables.; it can slow things down trying to “reverse engineer” the database schema if the database has tons of tables.
1200,hmm makes sense
1200,i wrote an app a couple years back that would reflect a database and provide a web api for CRUD on all the tables. it took like 10minutes to reflect the db.; lol; CRUD = create update and delete
1200,lol must of been extremely heavy yea basically I'll be making direct queries with an nagios like monitoring tool; but I''l be pulling values directly from the DB; but this should help me more than enough to get started
1200,that’s fine.; you can even create another engine for another db and and save to a different database lol.; if you needed to save locally for example.
1200,Interesting Yea I'll certainly take that idea Thanks again man <@Johana> :+1:
1200,"np, i came into python via sqlalchemy i was a DBA in a past life :wink:.; i got into web dev b/c i wanted to show data quickly to business users so then flask was a nice fit.; as a past database administrator i can tell you for a fact sqlalchemy is bad ass.; it is 10years old after all.; let me know how it goes <@Burma>"
1200,"<@Johana> I am trying to create a workflow for my buddy and I to work on a couple different webapps. Basically it consists of our local computers, the server where svn is hosting all my projects and then the production server to host the live webserver. I was talking with a coworker about it and he had mentioned setuptools might be useful for installing the projects out on the live server rather than having a make file just call *svn up* out on the production server. Setuptools is something I've avoided for a long while so I may not be explaining myself very well"
1200,"setuptools isn’t going to go put it on your server. you can use distutils to create a source distribution which is fine.; it will essentially create a tarball of your app you can copy to the server and extract.; you’ll use distutils for that.; Personally, i would use something like ansible or docker to deploy your app.; two things for that you will need a `<http://Manifest.in|Manifest.in>` file and `setup.py`; the idea is to create what is known as a “build artifact”."
1200,Will do <@Johana>
1200,a build artifact is like a windows .exe or a .deb file or a python wheel.; if you go the ansible route you can create a playbook with your buddy and only have your keys on the server so that only you two can deploy.; you can checkout pyslackers github for examples: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website/blob/master/ansible/playbook.yml>
1203,"interesting, looks like I was a bit confused about what's what. I'll look deeper into distutils and how it all works. Once I understand that aspect I'll look back at how to deploy it from there"
1200,"i’m a bit busy but i’ll be back with an example :wink:; this is the ansible task that I have that creates a source distro before it copies it to my server:
```
- name: Create source distribution
  sudo: false
  local_action: shell source {{ pylocal_venv }}/bin/activate &amp;&amp;  python setup.py clean sdist chdir=""{{ pylocal_source_dir }}"" executable=""/bin/bash""
  run_once: true
```; replace the jinja tags with the proper values; `source virtualenv_path/bin/activate &amp;&amp;  python setup.py clean sdist chdir=/application/dir`; you can then scp or sftp the source distro to the server.; if you want to do it manually.; in ansible extracting an archive is pretty easy:

```
- name: Copy and extract source onto server
  unarchive:
    src:  /local/dir/
    dest: /remote/dir
```"

1211,"So, I find myself recreating an existing Java application in Python.  One aspect is to generate an output XML file that must conform to a DTD file.  I've been using lxml.etree for generating the xml file.  

I have one problem.  The DTD requires certain types of nodes to occur before other types.    Before I start write sorting logic, is there anything that would consult a specified DTD and sort accordingly?; Assuming no, any best practice on sorting peer nodes by node-type?"
1211,"<@Margrett>, I’m drawing a blank, sorry"
1212,are you looking for something like with spring beans xml configuration?; something along the lines of importing <http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd> and going from there?
1211,"<@Margrett> Sorting? I'm confused, why don't you just define your schema or add the nodes in the correct order?"
1212,i don’t think so. you’ll have to generate the file and then validate it.; unless there is something new. I used to do HL7 messaging which had a similar workflow.
1212,"Oh I re-read - to move from invalid to a valid schema, :disappointed:; Anything trying to be more clever than <@Johana> suggestion is probably just going to make things worse"
1212,"it would be hard to catch all the edge cases.; you might be able to do something creative with a jinja2 template.; i did that once with some HL7 messages.; ```

```; <@Margrett> :point_up: I don’t know how much your data is changing but your schema definition should help you build the template.

1212,i mainly used it to report results of infections diseases to the USDA.
1212,"That looks way more sophisticated than we had.; I'm struggling to remember the name.   The whole thing was web based.; I did write code in Symantec Workflow, looks a little more similar.; SilverStream"
1212,gotta love windows nt.; ah i see you build web apps in it and it will deploy them at a very expensive cost.
1213,mirth may be able to do what you want as well. it’s opensource and geared to HL7 but HL7 is XML like anything else so i’m sure it can do a lot.
1212,"the big benefit i see a system that is geared for sending XML messages is that they typically have logging, retrying, etc. built in. It makes it really nice to just set it up and forget about it. I remember sometimes my workflow might hang up but the help desk guy had a login where he could restart the process."
1213,I would have killed for that back in ID mgmt days.
1214,"Hey all, would anyone know how to, using requests, to add a time.sleep to the requests get call and read the page after a number of seconds?"
1214,<@Elsie> afaik requests only includes functionality for a single request and is blocking so if you want to space out multiple requests you should be able to add the delay yourself in between
1214,Ok and excuse my ignorance but would I be calling for the same url?
1214,"Hmmm, that depends on what you're trying to do? Maybe take a step back and explain your overall goal?"
1214,Essentially scrape a page that has ajax calls or is built with react on their frontend
1214,"ohhh, then ignore my previous answer; requests will just return the content from a single request, it will not render any javascript"
1214,So would their be any work around to this other than running a selenium script?; there*
1214,"You can hit up <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping>, they'll probably get into the nitty gritty more"
1214,"I don't know any alternatives. When I was in that situation, I just used selenium"
1214,"Yeah I'd agree with <@Mallie>, go to <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping> if you can/want to talk about it in more detail. Overall the two approaches would be to use a browser engine/driver like selenium or be able to identify the ajax calls being made and then make those requests directly yourself"
1214,ok thanks all
1215,"How do you type hint a function as a variable received in a function?

1216,is there anything in Python that will take a dictionary / array of whatever structure and convert it to JSON as is? Everything I have seen so far is about defining serializers etc?
1216,Json.dumps()
1216,doesnt do nested objects?; e.g. if I have django model that has several other relationships fetched as part of a query it only ever encodes the first level
1216,I'm not sure about a Django model.
1216,well just think of it as nested objects; there doesnt seem to be anything analogous to PHP's json_encode; Which will take a nested object and recursively convert it to JSON
1216,I typically add a to_dict method to my sqlalchemy models.. I'm on a phone rn
1216,yeah I saw that on some stuff I looked at - I guess id have to define one for each model; painful
1216,"the django rest framework supports nested serializers, might be handy to look at their implementation if you're not using their framework"
1216,no you could simply create a mixin.; yea drf has all sorts of options for depth.
1216,everything I have seen with DRF requires me to declare the structure of the object; e.g. PersonObject -&gt; HeadObject -&gt; EyeObject etc; This seems overly verbose; I'm surprised there doesnt seem to be a one size fits all approach to this for a web framework like Django / DRF; I think the __dict method seems the cleanest and most re-usable
1216,you could try flask. it’s pretty simple to get a web api going.
1216,Ive inherited a Django project unfortunately; Just frustrating when you are used to doing things a different and faster way
1216,i had this frustration working with django originally but then i had a few more developers join me on a django rest framework and that verbosity made things a lot nicer to work with
1216,If it was a full on REST API it wouldnt be so bad but I literally just want to produce some JSON for some charts and i cant even do that; its a 2 minute job in PHP :disappointed:; If Django didnt produce such an easy admin id have considered rewriting it already
1216,"_gasp_ @ ""inherited a Django project unfortunately"""
1216,yea it’s hard to compete with PHP. :troll:

1222,"Hi mattes.
I need to change an ImmutableMultiDict to a simple dict.

Have this:
ImmutableMultiDict([('*conciliation_status*', 'NC'), ('*conciliation_status*', 'CA'), ('group_id', '1'), ('end_date', '2017-12-31'), ('start_date', '2017-01-01')])

and need this:
{'*conciliation_status*': ['NC', 'CA'], 'group_id': '1', 'end_date': '2017-12-31', 'start_date': '2017-01-01'}

I could resolve this case with something like this:
```
def normalize(data):
    normalized_data = {}

    for key, value in dict(data).items():
        if len(value) &gt; 1:
            normalized_data[key] = value
        else:
            normalized_data[key] = value[0]

    return normalized_data
```

But I wonder if there are others betters ways to do this.
Any idea?"
1222,"`dict(your_dict)` should work, no?; oh no, it returns list types as values"
1222,"<@Yan> your result example is inconsistent. Why `'*conciliation_status*'` is gathered into a list, but `'group_id'` is not?
I would expect to see `'group_id': ['1']` instead; If that's exactly what you want, then there's no sane generic solution."
1222,<@Winnifred> Don't work in this case. Thx

1227,sorry; have some problems
1227,well post what you have and how current behaviour is different from what you expect; and we will try to help you
1227,Good morning everyone!!! (its morning here in EST)
1228,"I am quite novice and need a little direction.
Just point me in the direction and I am happy to figure it out from there. I learn better that way. 
I am trying to write a program to ping all hosts in a subnet and then display the results in a table.
What I have already. (both found somewhere on the internet and modified for my needs...)
1. A ""ping sweep"" that will output the IP and DNS name of any host that respondes.
2. A simple Plotly program that will read a CSV and output it in an HTML table.; .; I am struggling to figure out how best to get my data into the plotly table. I am trying to avoid writing to a csv and then reading it back into the plotly table. Unless that is the best way to achieve my goal, then I will happily do that.
Ideas? 
I am currently reading up on dictionaries and seeing if that may serve my purpose...
Thank you for any help!!!"
1228,<@Virgen> you already have your data being parsed from the csv? You can use jinja templates to dynamically build the results into the table
1228,"negative. the plotly bit is just pulling data from a random test csv.; the ping sweep bit runs an if/then loop which tests each IP and returns the IP and DNS name if anything responds.; <@Lory> I'll check into jinja as well, thx!"
1228,"can you pop that into a code block, can't tell where the indentation is supposed to be; little plus sign next to the text input"
1228,<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>
1228,"<@Lory> I cannot, I get an upload error. I blame the webfilter and its admin... (i'm the webfilter admin...); <@Lory> I got the webfilter admin to fix his gear...; that's the general loop that outputs the data. So, rather than just printing the output to console, I want to store it in a way that can be read into and displayed in a table."
1228,"well for starters, that initial for loop where you're running `ping` on the servers, you're only ever capturing the output of the last one that runs in `output`, unless `stdout=...` is supposed to be within the for loop which it looks like it should be but is just an indentation error; yea so I would build some kind of dictionary or nested list and then use a jinja template to iterate over that data structure and create a table entry for each. That would definitely be a fairly easy approach"
1228,"I am generating a random int between 1 to 4 using `randint(0, 4)`, Is there a way to generate more 0's than the rest of numbers ?"
1228,<@Desire> You mean give 0 a higher probability?
1228,`random.choices()` has an ability to assign weights to choices
1228,<@Lory> Interesting. I will check out jinja. thank you!
1228,<@Desire> This might help: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26282222/generating-random-numbers-in-python-with-percentage-function-on-what-selected-va>
1228,"There are other approaches than jinja, but basically you want some way to template in data into table rows and then send that to the web page. There are other options out there, jinja is just what I'm used to personally"
1228,"Yes, you are right."
1229,"Morning, I was wondering if anyone had tips or a blog post about debugging multiple inheritance.  I'm using PyCharm and it's certainly helping but I feel like I'm missing something.; Of course googling ""debugging multiple inheritance python"" returns inheritance tutorials :confused: "
1229,have you checked the `.__mro__`  attr on your class?; mro = method resolution order and shows how your classes attrs are being built
1229,I have not.  I was about to get into the class tree PyCharm debugging but went on a walk (now)
1229,"and Python MRO is right to left, IIRC"
1229,I'm using Dask and it's got all this lazy executes on top of pandas and I think I'm getting lost in the weeds instead of high level
1229,"also, if there are `super` delegations, the last evaluated class goes to the base `type` class (i think) or metaclass; im being much too glib -- I would check out stuff around the method resolution order though :slightly_smiling_face:"
1229,"Thanks, will do"
1230,"Thanks, will look at that!"
1231,<http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/method-resolution-order.html>; Not so helpful for straight up debugging but it helped me understand python's MRO.
1232,Why would a class' attribute that is supposed to be set as a string end up as a tuple instead when a string is passed to self.attributename? I have a class where under __init__ it is using parameter names to pass in values to the attributes of the class object but when I pass in a string it turns it into a tuple with one value in it.
1232,can you post the code in a snippet?
1232,"<@Dorris> are you sure the string isn't ending with a `,`; `a = 'hello world', ` would create a tuple for example"
1232,"When debugging and I look at the value being passed in there is no `,`; Let me see if I can show you"
1232,`crmwebapi` is what's returning a tuple?
1232,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; school = 10,
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(school)
&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
```; `,` is a tuple ""operator"""
1232,crmwebapi is just the URI for the api call later in code I didn't show
1232,`CamelCase` :cry:
1232,Still learning how to be pythonic :stuck_out_tongue:; Coming from PowerShell background. Hard to let go sometimes I guess
1232,"I would just add a bunch of log statement or run ipdb and see what happen; haha no problem :smile: old habits die hard; actually yeah they are all tuple because you put a `,` a the end; it's only needed when creating a dict; ```
a = 1
b = 2
```"
1232,Beat me to it <@Ciera>
1232,should be like this
1232,you're right! Extra commas
1232,:slightly_smiling_face:
1232,Musta gotten them mixed up in my head with a dict or list or something; That's better
1232,yeah it's one of those thing that can easily bite you. it's one thing that could benefit from some improvments
1232,Thank you
1232,gotta be careful with commas
1232,"So, if I were to write it pythonicly :stuck_out_tongue:"
1232,parenthesis don't make a tuple
1232,Would that be with _ instead of camelcase?
1232,yup_thats_right

Now, I've fixed the name so it's `name=""my_package""`, but setuptools keeps putting `my-package` in the PKG-INFO file. I've looked everywhere for any trace of the name with a hyphen or a space, I've deleted the caches, run `setup.py clean`, changed the name to something else entirely, removed the parameter, traced through the setuptools code to see how it's set, and I can't get it to stop naming it `my-package` in PKG-INFO. Anyone have this issue before and have any suggestions?; wondering if a new virtualenv would help; but that seems silly too; this is running in a virtualenv based on python 3.5 on windows 10; tried in Python 2.7 (which had no knowledge of the package) with the same result. In the past, I've been able to have packages with underscores instead of hyphens; It may just be PyPI acting differently than I expect too - looks like the other packages I've made with underscores show as hyphens in PKG-INFO but as underscores on PyPI - this one doesn't"

1241,`not` :slightly_smiling_face:; as in `if not some_value:`
1241,:slightly_smiling_face:; tnks
1241,"`and`, `or` and `not` are the boolean ops"
1241,ok
1241,"took me a bit of getting used to, coming from java and JS"
1241,haha same as me; or same as you; english is not my first language too KKK; ops... KKK = hahaha in Brazil; dont get me wrong
1241,"ah, ok.  Here in the US, it means Ku Klux Klan, which is definitely not a haha :smile:"
1242,but good to know!
1241,<@Carolin> Do you pronounce it like 'kay kay kay'?
1242,yeah I know but only noticed after write it
1241,<@Mallie> not like  that 'cause the k here is little bit different is more like ka in  kakaroto ( <https://youtu.be/w8GGm9ZzgvU?t=23s> ) but in a laugh way. If you put in youtube 'risada brasileiro kkk' you should find some results
1243,<@Carolin> That is an interesting fact. What does kkk stand for?
1242,"<@Leif> is hahaha, a laugh or lol, not like in US that is Ku Klux Klan as <@Meg> talked earlier"
1244,"so in english, its more of a `caw` sound, than `kay`?"
1244,"hi guys, new to python , looking for a place to contribute ? any suggestions"
1245,"Can anyone help me set up a python environment in VIM? I’ve got most of the way there ( I think ) but I’ve got a few issues and questions… (Disclaimer: I’m totally new to VIM) DM me; Nevermind, I’ve got there I think.  My only issue is that YCM doesn’t autocomplete here: `from typing import ...` I expect it to pop up and offer the import like `List, Callable etc...`. However if I do `import List \n List.[popup]` it autocompletes all of the classes inside the site package there.. So I’ve missed a configuration somewhere or it’s just not meant to work like that"
1242,<@Meg> Japanese 'ka' in 'kakarot' is basically 'ca' in 'car'
1246,how did u set up the linter and autocomplition in vim? i legit was trying to do it for a while i couldnt get it
1242,Any C#/.NET users around?
1242,I've used it but I'm no expert
1242,"I may have found what I was looking for but basically I was just looking for any sort of standard opinion on how applications/projects should be laid out.; I think I was using the wrong terms and not finding much, but I know found some stuff that makes sense.; If you have a good resource to share that'd be cool, I was just lost for a few minutes of googling looking for something I thought would be pretty obvious."
1242,pluralsight has lots of .net junk. I learned visual basic in the aol 2.5 days.
1242,Most of what I did I read out of books a few years ago; This probably isn't the best place to look for help regarding .Net though
1247,has anyone used pthon fire for cli tools? was looking at click but this looks pretty easy too <https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/guide.md>
1247,"Click is much more explicit about what's going on... I don't like these examples. What I see from the guide, `fire` is full of implicit conversions to optional/required arguments, subcommands, etc."
1248,Yeah I much prefer Click and it’s what I recommended in my Reliable Tools talk 
1248,Kakarot is carrot; <http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Origins_of_character_names>; vegeta is part of vegetable; Maybe the author is vegetarian :))
1249,"Hey Guys, I’m looking for ideas on how to upskill my software dev team outside of reading news and blogs etc.  We’ve been together for a while and it all works, but, looking to freshen our process / skills with outside ideas.  Thanks in advance…Will."
1250,Conferences?
1249,"<@Evelin> a couple things come to mind

1. Hack day in office - each person picks something a little out of their area of expertise and tries to do something that has potential to benefit the company/ongoing projects.  
2. Host or attend a local meetup in one of the languages you work in
3. Consider Pluralsight/Udemy/Safari Online,  and other education sites as an employee perk
4. One or two conferences per year.  A different dev can go to each, and give a presentation/report when he/she comes back.  Previous position sent people to JavaOne, and they gave illuminating presentations after
5. Start being active in the dev group of the language/framework you typically work with.  eg, django developers on IRC, flask, etc"
1251,+1; also we're trying to implement a process where everyone can suggest a topic that he wants to give a presentation or wants to hear about it from someone else; and those presentations would be once a month or so
1251,"yes.  I suggested something similar a couple times at my office and it was done twice before the others developed a lack of interest; tough balance - does all the content come from a clique group, and the rest of the team kinda coasts along, or is it required that everyone do at least one a year?"
1251,"we won't make it required to attend; but want to provide food, drinks etc. to encourage people to stay after working hours"
1251,"yeah, this was like a scheduled block during the day, once a month; usually 90 minutes at 3p, and everyone could leave after"
1251,and do you have some more conclusions why it failed?
1251,"<@Evelin> too bad you’re out of the London area, or I could point you to some people at a company I know in Guildford; company culture, no driving force pushing standards and such."
1251,"ok, and how big is the company?"
1251,"entire team is pretty lazy in a number of ways, and very comfortable; 5 devs total, 15 people in all; so a pretty small one"
1251,hello
1251,"its a type of environment that I think fosters stagnation, in a number of ways"
1251,"oh, we're a small one too, but some kind of software agency, so about 15 developers, 2 QA and CEO"
1251,"fortunately, I’m isolated from about 95% of that"
1251,but looking for ways to scale and stay competetive against bigger and more well-known companies
1251,"part of the problem is the entire company started as a print publishing company, and moved to tech.  the owner was a subject matter expert originally, but is certainly not now nor ever when it comes to tech.  but she insists on having the kind of control over decisions as if she were.  Combined with the fact there is _no_ leadership at all, and its not suprising; its pretty well known that we need some sort of project manager involved, but no way will a hire ever happen for that"
1252,hello?
1251,"that's not good I guess, maybe one of you can go into  management"
1251,is tkinter a good library to use when starting with gui's?
1251,"Maybe eventually, but certainly not at this place "
1251,I played a bit with it and it was ok. Your gui's won't be beautiful but it should be a good start
1251,I'd say they've lost about 8M USD in about 9 years or so due lost sales and turnover as well as a huge mountain of technical debt that is making feature development move like molasses 
1251,yes its; true !!; you can try QT
1251,"Hell, git branching is black magic to some of them."
1251,"thanks, so if its a good base/starting point, what would be a ""beautiful gui""? id like it to remain free though"
1251,i guess PyQt
1251,i thought pyqt was paid?
1251,WxPython; open source
1251,must have misread it
1251,PyGTK
1251,"<https://insights.dice.com/2017/08/07/7-top-python-gui-frameworks-for-2017-2/>
```Conclusion
This is a great set of frameworks that should cover most needs. All except PyQt are completely free.```"
1251,GTK is for GNome environment
1251,There is some restriction on QT if you sell your product I believe
1251,"ah ok, so free for dev but paid for distribution? that sorta thing?"
1251,"```The Qt open source licensing is ideal for use cases such as open source projects with open source distribution, student/academic purposes, hobby projects, internal research projects without external distribution, or other projects where all (L)GPL obligations can be met.```"
1251,"ah ok, thanks"
1251,```The commercial Qt license gives you the full rights to create and distribute software on your own terms without any open source license obligations.```
1251,Do u mind if i ask about you ??
1251,in what way?
1251,tell me about you !
1251,so maybe those presentations should bring topics like git workflow and its' benefits?
1251,This is a weird conversation with all the quoting; There is no need to share every message as you respond. you can just respond - it's actually easier to follow that way
1251,"Especially after Kevin Spacey's coming-out...; By the ways, there are <#C07EFN21K|random> and <#C07EHQYFN|introductions> which are more suitable for such personal discussions."
1251,<@Collette> I am both surprised by the news and confused as to the relevance
1251,"Or, even, personal messages."
1251,"<@Emily> it is inappropriate to ask someone to talk about themselves in such a public forum. It's not exactly appropriate to ask in a private chat either, but it would be a better place than here. <@Toby> should also have no obligation to respond as well.

This is not a complaint, or necessarily a violation of any rules - more of a cultural custom you should be aware of in an English speaking forum."
1251,Sorry sir !; i should have asked this question at <#C07EHQYFN|introductions>
1252,Ah right now I see why you asked
1251,yes <@Toby> feel free to introduce yourself to the group in <#C07EHQYFN|introductions>
1251,got messed up with group! <@Vada> sir
1252,no worries
1251,okay
1253,"Should I be using list comprehension to `assert` that all members of a list parameter in my function are of a required custom class, or is there a cleaner way of doing it?; I tend to do a lot of `assert isinstance(param1, CustomClass)`"
1253,a list comprehension sounds like the best way to do it based on my experiences; unless there's a way to just do the entire list in one go which I am not aware of personally
1253,"Yah, I didn't see some hidden functionality in isinstance, at least from the official docs"
1253,But you won't be using the resulting list anyway... Why not just `for param in params: assert(....)`?
1253,you could have your class self validate before being appended to the list or something too. depends on your code structure but the various approaches all do the same thing at the end of the day
1253,"I probably should just use a normal for loop, that way I can complain about the specific non-conforming item.; In my current code, I'm just talking to myself, but this is very similar to a another one of my projects where I expect random  non-python proficient people to be using my classes; Figured I should try to be consistent in my approach :slightly_smiling_face:"
1253,I personally wouldn't use a list comprehension if I didn't intend to use the resulting list for anything
1253,"could also do a test in the list comprehension, and use `any` and `all` type checks"
1253,```Should I be using list comprehension to `assert` that all members of a list parameter in my function are of a required custom class``` Should you really do that and not let it fails later on ?
1253,"My general philosophy is to fail fast.  In this tool, if a user provides me with wacky input data, it could be devastating to the downstream systems that I'm re-configuring.; I do like the potential idea of using any/all, need to play with that.  Could make the code more readable"
1253,yeah I use that sometimes and like it.  the inline assert seems nice too as well
1253,"A simplified example:
```my_ints = [1,2,3]
assert all(isinstance(i, int) for i in my_ints), 'my_ints must all be integers'```; Seems to meet the test of being self-documenting; Thanks <@Junita>, <@Truman>, <@Scot>,<@Ciera> Thanks for the help with the assert list question :taco:"
1253,om nom nom.  np

1253,"Hi all, wondering if anyone could help make my code less repetitive.

1254,Anyone got any experience using the pyrebase library for Firebase?
1253,<https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark>
1255,"<@Meg> That's a really great list of things :taco: 

<@Evelin> We did a rotating presentation at work on a dev focused topic, that helped a bit to open up discussion towards newer ways of doing things. We also had a couple hours a week dedicating to do ""learning"" but it worked better when there was a discussion about what that was and what the goals were, honestly most devs didn't even use it :disappointed:
Meetups is not something you can force but it's definitely helped me to upskill a lot.

Looking back, the times that our team/tech did move up was when one person was assigned the responsibility to implement a new process and spent the time actually implementing it, then doing a presentation on it so that the others know what's going on and how to work with it now that it's there."
1256,"Hi Guys , I have a json Que and I want to check for some value ordering , what is the fastest way to do that?
{ First Property : true , Second Property:false} I want to be sure that the First Property showed in this que before the Second Property"
1256,Do you know what the order is prior to run time or is it dynamic?
1256,sounds like you need to make a priority queue
1256,"actually all I have is dictionary with some json objects in it ,I want to know how can I check if one of those objects come before another one or not"
1256,Dictionaries are unordered by default
1256,"yes you are right; that's why is not that easy to do that , my dictionary is specific dictionary which the order is important to me"
1256,Lists are ordered so that's reliable but only helps if you know what you're looking for. I've never used priority ques so I'm not sure how they work personally
1256,You could try using an ordereddict; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict>
1256,let me check thnx; I don't thinks that's will work <@Antionette>
1256,<@Elanor> are you looking to sort your dictionary by key or value?
1256,ordered dicts only work with insertion order; sounds like you need to write a list comp to output your dict to a list based on the key value
1256,"I thought 3.6 had order in order out for dicts, now I have to go check..."
1256,"3.6 does have dicts that are ordered by default. However, they aren't promised to be in future versions."
1256,"totally understand that, and he may not be able to 3.6 for a variety of reasons"
1256,I;m using 2.7
1256,"and when you say they are ordered, are they ordered by a key or a value or are you thinking that they're are indexed?"
1256,"They are ordered in the way they were created, not based on any other logic."
1256,<@Elanor> what is it about OrderedDict that think won't work?; and is the creation of the dictionary a one-time thing?
1256,my dict's value is another dictionary
1257,conceptually it doesn't change the problem of ordering if it is nested or not
1256,"I think I solved this problem , because I have enabled the timpestamp; and then I dont need to have the dictionary ordered or not , since it will come with timestamp"
1257,Yeah there's an easy method there
1258,"Hi, I recently was asked to work on a django project and I’m having a little difficulty getting the app set up locally.  Python 3.6 and django 1.11.  I created the database and went to run the migration files, but I get an error saying “relation table_name does not exist”.  That table should be created by the first migration file based on what I can tell.  I’m not sure why it would be complaining about a table not existing when there are no tables at all (brand new db).  Should I be deleting the migration files and running makemigrations?  That doesn’t seem to make much sense, but not sure at this point. I’m a rails and phoenix developer, this is my first time with django.  Any help or suggestions would be awesome!"
1258,You should probably run your own. Who knows what state the DB was in when those first migrations were generated; It sounds like you're missing some or the tables/database were created outside of Django
1258,should I delete the migrations folder and run makemigrations?
1258,Yes..; an make sure you have the database existing; makemigrations and migrate..
1258,"the database exists, so I deleted the migrations folder and ran makemigrations, I got the same error as before.  ‘’'psycopg2.ProgrammingError: relation “proposals_proposal” does not exist
LINE 1: ...estions”, “proposals_proposal”.“final_price” FROM “proposals...‘’'"
1258,Try running `manage.py migrate proposals`; I've had migrations that got in to a state where one app had to be run before all the others
1258,"same error, it’s like it’s stuck!  I can’t get away from it."
1258,Which migration file is throwing the error?
1258,"Well, there isn’t any migration files now, I deleted the entire directory.  So in theory, it shouldn’t be throwing an error at all on a migration file.; but prior to deleting the directory, I ran the very first migration file 0001_initial.py and it produced the same error."
1259,CAn you share the stack trace
1260,You can add an `__init__` and then print the variables of your choice. <@Vena>
1260,"so, when making a library that you plan on only supporting 3.6+, do you still use or worry about things like `six` or custom `compat.py` modules?"
1260,<@Bruno> I don't. Why?
1260,just curious. i havent either.
1260,Morning  everyone! :}
1260,good evening
1260,<@Bruno> i would love some help if you don't mind me asking
1260,@Furkanzmc thank you
1260,i'm currently sudying on team treehouse right know and i'm stuck on a question
1260,"<@Ricki> idk if i will be able to, but its an open forum. just ask and if someone knows and can help they probably will"
1260,any advice anyone?
1260,what is your problem
1260,its saying i made a mistake
1260,check where your quotes are; `.format()` is a function that operates on a string
1260,"it says that i don't have to print() anything to pass the quiz, so how do i use the .format() in my variable?; i understand how to use it in print()"
1260,"when in a terminal like that, you dont need to use print as whatever the result is, it will output to the console."
1260,oh
1260,"so, look at the format, on how you use string.format(), then compare to how you are using format. there is a syntax error in your code.; one of the last few lines; look at the last line and what is spit out. it means that the line before it is one whole string; did you find it <@Ricki>?"
1260,checking it out now <@Bruno>; man.. i still don't get it <@Bruno> i sware i'm going to go bald :grimacing:
1260,"lol its ok; so the syntax of format is `""some string {name}"".format(name)`; check your quoting"
1260,"This is what i have 'code' subject=""Treehouse loves{}"".format(name)"
1260,"thats the line with the error; in the image, its different"
1260,yes
1260,you moved the last double quote
1260,i just updated it to what you typed
1260,that should work. `subject` should now spit out the proper text; you had the last double quote at the end; do you see what the error was? is it working for you now?
1260,"i see, my errors was, but this thing still won't let me pass.. :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
1260,might need a space between `loves` and `{}` ?
1260,"nothing <@Bruno>  but i'm going to sleep on it, thanks anyways! I really do appreciate it, i  will dm you later :fist::skin-tone-4:"
1260,np; good luck
1260,what is the latest stable version of 3.4?
1260,locally pyenv tells me it is `3.4.6`; <@Winnifred>
1260,"Ah, thanks <@Bruno>!; I need to learn that command. I r `pyenv` n00b."
1260,Si; just check out the pyenv library; i dont use it to manage my virtual envs. i just use it to install python versions.; i use pipenv
1260,"gotcha, what are your thoughts about installing virtualenv on each version and creating them that way?"
1260,what do you mean?; create a venv for each version of python?
1260,"well, installing a venv manager on each version"
1260,i just create them as I need them; nah.; if you install pyenv you can use that to manage installation of whole python versions. then i just use pipenv to manage my environemnts. which uses `pew` under the hood. so i use that to create the actual env.
1260,"ah, okay"
1260,"so my workflow:
```
pipenv install 3.4.6
pew new --py ~/.pyenv/versions/3.4.6/bin/python my_env_name
# this will auto activate the environment
```
then if i want to activate that env later i just do ```pew workon my_env_name``` and `exit` to leave the environment; or, you can run a command from within that environment without activating it, just `cd` into the project with a `Pipfile` and you can run `pipenv run -- flask run` to run flask, for example; but i find it easier to just activate the env"
1260,"Nice, I'll have to check out `pipenv`."
1261,"Hey Everyone ! Quick (meta) questions for you guys. I wasn't sure what channel post them so here goes: I recently had my ""aha"" moment with regards to multithreading and I was wondering if it it's relevant to use such an approach in the context of web scraping (if you have a ton of sites to extract data from) or in the context of database interaction (say you have a csv and you want to insert each row as a row in a given DB) is there any benefit to that ? What's your experience ?; Also, if the main reason for multithreading is to speed things up then why do we use locks (don't they defeat the purpose if other threads have to wait for locks to be released before proceeding ?) Thanks in advance for your clarifications"
1261,"<@Gwenda> because threads can share the same memory. If two or more threads try to modify a list, for example, you can't predict the exact order of modifications. Thus you need a lock to make sure such mutable shared memory can be modified by a single thread at a time.; If you don't share any memory, then you don't need any locks. But in that case you actually don't need threads - you need multiple processes"
1261,ah very interesting point !; so if memory access is not an issue then multiprocessing is more suited ?
1261,"It really depends on your actual use-case, but in general - yes.; The whole point of having multiple threads is to avoid expensive communication between isolated memories, by having a shared memory."
1261,ah I see now ! Makes sense; thanks <@Collette>!
1262,I am looking to plot time series data for multiple data values together any leads to do so in python?
1263,"Morning, Just wondered if any has any experience with a good method to cleanly terminate all threads with Ctrl C on a script using multiprocess pool map?"
1263,isn't ctrl c the same as the kkill signal?; If you have the thread ids you can just send a kill signal for each id; via bash
1263,havent done a whole lot with Multiprocessing with python I have tried the normal try except with KeyboardInterrupt: but it just kills the current thread I assume; as it just continues
1263,"You have to find the root id, otherwise it will keep spawning more processes no?"
1263,Yeah it just continues I've tried a few stackoverflow posts but cant find a good answer for it

1264,JS doesn't have the concept of list comprehensions as far as I know
1264,"im just trying to follow this <http://code.jasonbhill.com/python/project-euler-problem-11/> but write it in js like i have the other problems; ill have to skip it, thanks anyway"

1264,"<@Lory> if you work with dates, it's probably good idea to convert strings to `datetime` objects, and manipulate them instead of strings"
1265,very much :point_up:
1265,I initially had taken that route but the data I am pulling dates out of comes form a few different sources as strings. I figured the date time approach would work in a more predictable environment rather than here where I am conditionally modifying specific pieces and at times reusing the same data for new results. It get's converted after this function returns when I am ready to do my db inserts; would you have a suggestion as to how to constructively build a date with arbitrary y/m/d information using the date time method? I am not too familiar with how to use it correctly so I may have had a bad implementation
1265,<@Lory> sounds like a job for <http://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html>
1265,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime>
1265,"`strptime` is good when you have a fixed known format, `dateutil` is good when you just need to parse damn dates :slightly_smiling_face:"
1265,"yep. with only a few different format I'm not sure which one is the best, but idk how many different format mike expect"
1265,"I'll look deeper into that aspect. However, ignoring the dates and looking at the if/else structure I have set up, is there any other way to construct it such that I don't need 2 areas in which I check the status of `has_day` or is that inherently impossible because I need to first check the length of the date I have?; and all formats end up being `yymmdd` it's just a matter of what does it have currently, what is it expected to have and then any missing information is appended if needed, aka the day information which defaults to `01`"
1265,on the top of my head I don't have any idea to check both condition
1265,Fair enough. I have a tendency to look too much into optimization lol. I'm going to dive into those date formats and see how that goes
1265,well you could do a function but if the check is only a line or two long it's not necessary
1265,"Exactly what I was thinking, it would just take from the readability of the code"
1265,depending on the conditions sometime having a 4 branch if/elif might be more readable but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1265,lol thanks. I'll just let it be for now and maybe I'll have an epiphany one day
1266,"Quick question... What does the line ""Global E"" (Line 6) do in the following code snippet?"
1266,"as I recently found out, that allows you to create mutable global variables"
1266,"It doesn't create them, it says the global is mutable from within this function."
1266,Well in that one it is in a comment; so it doesn't do anything
1266,Which is something you generally want to avoid doing in a production level piece of software. I personally cheat when writing test scripts to work out a specific function
1266,correct. commented or not makes no difference when I run the snippet.
1266,They are probably indicating they are using the global E.
1266,<@Meghan> E has not been created beforehand so does get created there.
1266,"And yes, there is rarely a reason for it."
1266,actually you are right sorry; it gets declared later - this is just the person saying it is the global E
1266,"<@Virgen> without `global foo`, `foo = something` creates a local variable `foo` instead of modifying the global one"
1266,"That isn't really later, since the stuff outside of the function are executed before the function."
1266,<@Meghan> corrected myself after :wink:
1266,"I think I understand. So, if I were to expand on this initial snippet and wanted to use ""E"" later on, outside of the function, I would need to use the ""Global E"" to change the Global variable.; without the ""Global E"", the value of E would be unchanged outside of the function.; correct?"
1266,"If you wanted to modify it in some way yes, otherwise if it is simply a reference variable like a file path or something that you do not plan on modifying, then you do not need `global`; you only need `global VARIABLE` when you plan on modifying that data structure, which as everyone says, shouldn't really be done"
1266,"In that snippet, in that function. Is ""E"" getting modified? Or is it being used to assign the users input to ""string""?"
1266,here is a good SO post on it.; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693385>
1266,"in which case, ""string"" is what would hold that data that would get used later."
1266,"And in the code given, E is not modified; it is assigning the users input to `string`"
1266,it isn't it is simply being referenced and saved in the variable `string` which is local to that function and therefore mutable
1266,"so even more of a reason that ""Global E"" is unnecessary."
1266,mutability is a different thing....
1266,?
1266,yep
1266,"got it. Thank you all!; and, <@Vada> I'll check out that SO post. thank you!; <@Lory> how did you format the snippets in your posts?"
1266,"and <@Vada> is correct I didn't mean mutable, just that it is local and you can assign new data to that variable. mutability has to do with 'identity'  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8056130/immutable-vs-mutable-types>

and how do you mean <@Virgen>, your formatted code looks the same as mine as far as I can tell"
1266,<@Virgen> <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>
1266,"The problem I am finding with this is I don't know how to then modify the `day` if I need to later on in my code depending the `has_day` flag I was showing off earlier. Would I have to convert it back to a string, modify it and then reconvert back to date time?"
1267,I believe you can do `date.day = 1`; but you'll need to test
1266,<@Lory> I meant the small bits within your replies. `like this`. which I have now figured out is back ticks. thanks <@Meg>
1266,"<@Virgen> ah, sorry didn't realize you meant those. Glad you figured it out though!"
1266,":thumbsup: it helps alot; and also, it carries over from github issues too; and StackOverflow"
1268,"<@Lory> anytime date/time/day anything like that shows up, I immediate ask if they've check out the arrow package, if either for implementation or for source code analysis

1272,"hello community! :slightly_smiling_face: 
my ideas are currently blocked by the following problem:

*context:* i’m trying to build a simple (read-only) python api client for a storage product, but as I’m lazy I’m trying to do things dynamically… 
*problem*: the api server has endpoints like this:
```
GET: /monitor/host?nodeId=xxx[&amp;region=xxx]
GET: /monitor/nodelist?[region=xxx]
GET: /system/version
GET: /usage
```
my idea was to create classes for each endpoint (monitor, system, usage, etc), and get the “child-endpoint” (/monitor/*host* or /monitor/*nodelist*, etc) dynamically… but then, I would still need to get all URL the parameters (*nodeId*, *region*, etc)… the usage I have in mind is something like this:
```
client = WhateverStorageApi()
client.monitor.host(hostId='node01', region='eu-west-1') # this would generate: /monitor/host?nodeId=node01&amp;region=eu-west-1
```
my problem is: __getattr__ isn’t aware of any **kwargs, and __call__ only works for whenever I call a class.. is there any other well-known way of achieving this? so far I came up with:
```
class Monitor(object):

    base_url = 'monitor'
    
    def __getattr__(self, endpoint, **kwargs):
        
        base_call = '/{base_url}/{endpoint}'.format(
            base_url=Monitor.base_url,
            endpoint=endpoint
        )
    
        if 'nodeId' in kwargs.keys():
            base_call += '?nodeId={node_id}'.format(
                node_id=kwargs['nodeId']
            )
    
        if 'region' in kwargs.keys():
            base_call += '?region={region}'.format(
                region=kwargs['region']
            )
    
        # do something with base_call
``` 
(which I know… it simply doesn’t work)"
1273,what's the best way to mock a method on a mock object?
1273,I am trying to groupby two columns on a DataFrame and select a third column; not sum count or aggregate; any way I can only select a third column based on all available combinations of first two columns in a dataframe?
1274,"Do you mean something like :
```
df.groupby(['A','B'])['C']
```"
1273,yes lili i guess this should work?; sorry doesnt work but thanks
1275,"the first thing that came to my mind was something like this ```from functools import partial
class Monitor(object):

    base_url = 'monitor'
    def __getattr__(self, endpoint, **kwargs):
        base_call = '/{base_url}/{endpoint}'.format(
            base_url=Monitor.base_url,
            endpoint=endpoint
        )
        return partial(set_params, endpoint=base_call)

def set_params(endpoint, **kwargs):
    if 'nodeId' in kwargs.keys():
        endpoint += '?nodeId={node_id}'.format(
            node_id=kwargs['nodeId']
        )
    if 'region' in kwargs.keys():
        endpoint += '?region={region}'.format(
            region=kwargs['region']
        )
    return endpoint

```; example usage ```In [9]: monitor = Monitor()

In [10]: monitor.host(nodeId='a')
Out[10]: '/monitor/host?nodeId=a'
```; did you have something similar in mind or did I completely misinterpret your question?"
1276,"holy fuck! that is exactly what I needed!; :heart:; thank you; check this out:
```
class Monitor(object):
    base_url = 'monitor'
    def __getattr__(self, endpoint):
        def handler(**kwargs):
            return self._magic(endpoint, **kwargs)
        return handler
    def _magic(self, command, **kwargs):
        print command
        print kwargs


a = Monitor()

1284,"Hey folks. Take a look at this project: <https://github.com/datamade/census/blob/master/census/core.py>. I’m thinking about ways to make it more intuitive based on what it’s trying to model. For example, `acs5` and `acs5dp` are two different methods of `Census()`. But the class associated with `acs5` (`ACS5Client()`) is really where the meat of the method is, and the `ACS5DpClient()` class is just two variables that replace variables of `ACS5Client()`. Further, what I’m thinking would make more sense based on how the API is organized (see: <https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html>) is if there were `acs5.detail`, `acs5.dataprofile`, `acs5.subject`, and `acs5.comparison` attached to `Census.acs5`. How would I go about reorganizing this code to make that happen? I’m thinking it has something to do with adding those methods to the `ACS5Client()` class, but… *TL;DR:* I don’t grok how these classes fit together, or really classes in general."

1288,new to python .... could you please tell me what a mock is in python?
1289,can someone please help with kivy? im struggling with the rules
1289,There’s a <#C07FJKDNH|kivy> channel in this team. I bet you could get a hand from someone there.; <@Kenny> It looks like the “Dp” could be done away with completely by just initializing the ACS{n}Client classes with the variables that the Dp classes supply.; Honestly there are a few things about that library that could be improved.
1289,nobody seems to be active in that channel tho
1289,"<@Kenny> 
The first would probably to be break those classes out into more than one file called `core.py`. With a name like core it makes me think that they were going to add more files/break up the core file but then just didn’t.
The second would be all of the cryptic class names. I guess if you know the field/datasets they make sense, but they don’t to me. The names themselves would be fine, but they don’t have a single doc string in the whole file.
My other nitpick is the gratuitous use of whitespace. That’s just a style preference I have, but they have dozens of blank lines all over the place and I find it distracting and think it makes it harder to read."
1289,"<@Toby> then unfortunately, you might have to look elsewhere for kivy help."
1289,"<@Toby> I just noticed that I was the second person to recommend you look in the kivy channel, and that you already did."
1289,i asked a question in that channel yesterday and nobody has messaged in it since
1289,"yeah, its definitely a low-activity channel"
1289,yeah... and google doesnt help much
1289,"which suggests there are not many people in this community with knowledge and familarity; so, even if you keep asking here, I doubt you’re going to get any kind of meaningful response"
1289,true..
1289,have you checked out the google group/mailing list for that project?
1289,ive looked in a couple of groups when googling it but nothing besides that
1289,<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kivy-users>
1289,"I don’t think I can help with kivy. I can suggest an alternative though. There’s a guy working on a group of projects called beeware. Of particular interest to you might be VOC <https://pybee.org/project/projects/bridges/voc/>. Essentially, his goal is to write a python bytecode transpiler to convert python into native bytecode for other platforms, like java, allowing you to write apps, etc… in python."
1289,ill just have to struggle i guess
1289,<@Toby> we all struggle in our field of work lol
1289,"true, very true"
1290,"<@Harlan> haha agreed, but since I'm not deeply involved with this project, I was looking to just tackle some of the low hanging fruit rather than reorganize the whole thing. The class names do kind of make sense based on what its modeling, but yeah more comments would be nice."
1291,"Guys, thanks so much for your advice on this, it’s really helpful, I’ll let you know how I get on!"
1292,"Can anyone answer some possibly beginner level questions - To do with SQL, Python, Flask(Or Django)? Might take up a chunk of text here, can direct message if anyone is willing"
1292,If it's about flask / django it might be better to ask in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> or in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> or more globally in <#C07EYDP25|webdev> :slightly_smiling_face:
1292,"True, it's super entry level...Let me post the question and then if you think i should still head over there I will; What I’m making is a Key Performance Indicator dashboard, ideally in a web app.

I have a bunch of small scripts to preform the actions that I need, but would ideally like to have a user be able to click a button on the webpage, and that script is run on whatever computer is hosting the site. Flask or Django – I’m assuming I’ll be able to do this with Flask or Django?

I’m also using sqlite3 as the database – There may be many people looking at this page, but only ever 2 people editing. Will be small edits, but the likelihood of to people committing items to the database at the same time are very slim. Should this be alright, or should I be switching to something like postgr..Mysql, etc"
1292,Django and Flask views are python at the end of the day so you can execute whatever tasks you need.
1292,"Perfect, any preference (and reason) that you would go with one over the other in this situation?"
1292,"my standard answer:

```
flask is really nice especially if you like sqlalchemy. it's one of the reasons i still build many things in flask. i think flask has some things that make it really easy to get started at the beginning but can also mislead you as well. flask is a microframework so it has to be built up in pieces (called extensions) and has a lot of flexibility. this flexibility can start to become an issue when your application grows and you get errors about circular imports. a good tip to start out with when building flask web applications is to be aware that there are two very important patterns when structuring your app: 
a) application factory
b) blueprints
a good project structure at the beginning doesn't hurt!

Django is an entire framework and has opinions of its own. Django has opinions on what template language and database orm you should use. Django will provide you with all the tools. It is possible to change template languages from Django to Jinja2. The biggest plus about Django is it's the most sought after developer position in the python web world. Django gives you everything you need in one place. That's the nice thing about Django is it has made a lot of decisions for you. This enforced structure allows you to be focused and very proficient. The Django Rest Framework is legendary in the Python world and makes it fun to build Rest apis and you also get a professional looking browsable api with it. When you work with Django you know it's a professional framework. That's why they say it's for, ""perfectionists with deadlines.""

It can never hurt to learn Django or any python web framework. There are a lot of the patterns that remain the same like MVC and these sorts of things.

One of the first times i entered the #pocoo channel on irc i saw a conversation between armin ronacher, the creator of flask, and someone else. armin said something that i can't forget. He said, ""flask will not make or break your project."" Both Django and Flask have excellent documentation and will appeal to different people. Why not try both?

Django and Flask are two web frameworks that help you solve problems in different ways. If you are new to python i recommend flask bc i think it gets you a lot for your milage at the beginning and once you get the hang of building applications moving on to Django or Pyramid is not an issue. The concepts you learn building a wsgi web application transfer to other wsgi applications. (edited)
```"
1292,"Excellent answer, thank you"
1292,it’s probably one of more light handed flask vs django responses you’ll get.
1292,"I have zero experience with either, so it's great. I'll start with flask, no harm eventually learning both"
1292,i’m mainly a flask dev but that wouldn’t stop me for applying for a django job. there may be some large gaps in my knowledge how things are done but the underlying concepts are the same :wink:.
1293,Awesome...appreciate your responses
1293,Anyone have a link to a PyCharm-flavored `pep8` config file?
1293,? pycharm has pep8 built in; what are you needing?
1293,i think its for use outside of pycharm. that’s what it sounds like.
1293,"i'm not 100% certain, but i think pycharm is just using `flake8` behind the scenes; maybe w/o the complexity algo"
1293,it uses pep8.py <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>
1293,TIL
1293,me too lol
1293,"PyCharm violates at least one default (line length), but maybe not others. If that is the only derivation that's easy then.; I'm brand new to PyCharm."
1293,"eh, line length isn't the most important"
1293,Do you know what max is in PyCharm?
1293,nope. i don't even know if there is one
1293,Ah I see it indicated but I'm so new I'm figuring out how to read it.
1293,i just always turn on a right ruler in every editor
1293,the one they set for you automatically is 79 chars
1293,"So mine came out-of-the-box at 120, found it.; I didn't change any Code Style settings."
1293,79 is a good default. gives you a single character to wrap up with; embrace the `()`s for continuations and breaks
1293,"I like that too, it's a project I don't manage but people use PyCharm, that's why I was trying to work it all out."
1293,pycharm is a solid platform
1293,"I've always verified with normal `flake`/`pep8`, so I didn't know why they were saying it was PEP8.; It looks like that is the only variation.; `pycodestyle --max-line-length=120` does the trick though"
1293,"I always strive for 80, but if it’s cleaner to break the rule I’ll do it. If you’ve exceeded 110, 99.9% of the time it’s cleaner to break up the line."
1294,"```In [35]: ser.write(b'at+cusd=1, ""*99#"", 15')

1295,Is anyone familiar with Django translations ?
1295,"&gt; Django translations
Good band name"
1295,"yeah, what are you trying to do or having a hard time with?"
1295,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47081717/python-serial-port-ussd-command-throw-error>
1296,"I have a .po file with the translations I want to make, and believe I have my settings configured correctly, but the trans tagged headers in my html aren't being translated when changing the Content-Language http response header to 'es' for spanish."
1296,"okay, there are a number of steps you might need to take here; first, you need to have a _compiled *.mo* file_ to actually use the translations; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/#compiling-message-files>; then you need to change how you're setting the language; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/#how-django-discovers-language-preference>; if you're using the request, it looks like you need to change the request header name - I've always used the 'standard' way of having the user make a selection from, say, a form, which sets a session variable for their language choice"
1296,"Ah I see, I tried to use the django-admin command, compilemessages, and got this issue ""Can't find msgfmt. Make sure you have GNU gettext tools 0.15 or newer installed.
"".  I checked with Brew, and I do have the most up to date version.; of gettext; nvm, just had to run 'brew link --force gettext'; Is there a way to just run compilemessages on one locale directory ? When I run it from the root of my app it goes through all my third party directories that have locale files and recreates .mo files for those as well. The problem is that this causes a ""plural forms expression could be dangerous"" value error because it is re-setting the plural-forms variable in some .po files"
1297,"I don't think there is, but if you really need to compile only a specific file I don't see any reason why you couldn't do it with other tools; Django's tooling here is mostly porcelain around the gettext toolset"
1298,"I am jumping ahead a little on my intro to dictionaries but how can i add up the values of a sub dict? here is my dictionary; ```chest_piece = {
	""gear_set"": ""Nomad"",
	""Armour"": 1751,
	""gear_stats"": {
		""firearms"": 205,
		""stamina"": 1234,

	},
	""gear_mods"": {

```def gear_calc():
	overall_gear_score = sum(base_stats.chest_piece[""gear_stats""].values())
	return overall_gear_score```"
1298,is it working ? do you get an error ? :slightly_smiling_face:
1298,i tried running the file in terminal i didnt get anything
1298,does it have a print statement in it?
1298,you'll need to add some `print` to get any output in the console
1298,will it add up the firearms / stamina values etc? as gear_stats doesnt have any values
1298,yeah I’d expect it to return 1644
1298,"ok nice ill have a play around thanks guys; to get the firearms. value would i do `chest_piece[""gear_stats""][""firearms""]`"
1298,yes
1298,thanks

1306,"any thoughts on best practice for variable names during a for each loop in python?

for i in items:
```
i is a terrible name because it's generally used for the index
```

for item in items
```
item is a poor choice because:
- refactoring tools may or may not be able to figure out 'item' needs to be changed if 'items' is renamed to something else.
- converting between plural and singular all the time is annoying and inconsistent.
- 'item' looks too similar to 'items'.
- if the list has a long name the nested code looks ugly. 
- if the loop is small, it's completely pointless and adds no value.
```

i kinda want to use ‘v’ or ‘e’ and just stick with it all the time, but nobody is doing this so i assume there is a reason for it?

i really hate for each loops lol, i like standard for loops"
1306,"uhm; I really don’t care, tbh.  as long as its obvious what is the variable and what is the data structure; and the data structure name is appropriate"
1306,"yeah, and I gotta say, I’m actually a huge fan of the plural vs singular thing.  I think that adds more clarity, not less"
1306,"for example, `item in items` is pretty easy to figure out, because one is plural and the other is singular; then, when using `enumerate`, I do `for idx, val in enumerate(some_data_structure):`"
1306,"yup.  also, in general, probably not worth overthinking; if it’s generally clear what’s going on, and there are no obvious problems, then it’s good to go"
1306,:thumbsup: for not overthinking
1306,"inevitably you’ll be back there in a couple months anyway and go, “geez this is total crap, who wrote this!”  *runs git blame* “oh”"
1307,"for ? in my_list_with_a_specific_name:

what we doing here?; fwiw, i’m only over thinking this because i keep having to think about it when coding, i’d rather stick to something consistent and never think about it.; i think for item in items is perfectly fine, and probably a poor example. in reality it’s never usually that simple, and the list won’t necessarily even have a singular name. i guess it doesn’t really matter overall, just feels like i shouldn’t be thinking about this lol. if i had to come up with a unique variable name instead of using ‘i’ in regular for loops, it would begin to annoy me too :smile:"
1307,what I usually do I name list with a plural so when doing `for i in my_list` I can use the singular; `for message in messages`
1307,"you won’t always be able to come up with a natural sounding name that has a singular version though, and even trying to do it in the first place bugs me a bit. i guess i’ll just stop being so obsessive over the little things :wink:"
1307,it's not possible some time but most yes; but yeah if you can find something good enough it's probably :thumbsup:; you can also rename later
1307,"that’s the thing though, i don’t want to have to rename shit later haha, i’d rather just stick it as some single letter constant and never think about it again in my life"
1307,always using the same letter for indices will get confusing sometime; what if you have two loops ?
1307,"then i would give them descriptive names; but that case is rare enough that i don’t care, and i think in that case it actually adds a lot of value to be descriptive"
1307,"&gt; adds a lot of value to be descriptive
In any case it add value"
1307,i’m mostly talking about 1 level deep loops no longer than 10 lines. they come up all the time and i don’t think a descriptive name adds any value to the code at all
1307,"then the convention is to use `i` and `k, v` for dict"
1307,"can we use i there? i’ve wanted to, i just haven’t because i thought it would be conflicting with the tradition of calling the index i; k, v i like a lot, consistent and easy :slightly_smiling_face:; i think i’m going to go with ‘i’ and if people complain i’ll blame you :wink:"
1307,haha :thumbsup:
1308,"I use i, j and k,v when the values are non-obvious, as you describe.; specific names otherwise"
1309,"having written a good bit of c++, I often use 'it' which works for 'item' or 'iterator'. or sometimes I just use i, j, k or x, y, z in nested loops. It's mostly just style since the loop items/indexes are very local and not 'in scope' after a dozen-ish lines or less"
1310,"bash scripting question, anyone ever use the ImageMagick command line tool? Trying to center one image over another and getting mixed results"
1310,mixed results how; horizontal or vertical offset working?
1310,"I was getting incorrect dimensions but I am just now realizing that I had the order of images wrong so I was overlaying the background on top of the foreground image, and since it was transparent it just looked like nothing was happening"
1309,"Alright now I really don't know what's going on with this bash script if anyone can help out. If I specify a `-d` option, then my output file variable is an empty string which breaks on the `mkdir -p`, if I don't specify the default holds correctly but then `convert -size ""${w}""x""${h}"" canvas:""${color}"" ""${out}""/""${img}""` fails because it can't open an image? even though that command doesn't open an image and is instead creating one? Am I just going crazy?"
1310,"this is just a simple script for making images square, it takes two optional arguments, a color for the background (defaults to transparent) and a name for the output directory (defaults to `square_out`)"

1319,"<@Mitzie> plenty of options: you can replace `sys.stdin` with a custom file-like object (for example, `io.StringIO()`), you can mock `yourmodule.input`, or you can mock `builtins.open`; I would either go with replacing `sys.stdin` or exclude logic into a separate function, without calling `input` and test this function instead; as I expect `input` to be tested by the python testing suite"

'1'
&gt;&gt;&gt; six.binary_type(2)

b'\x00'
&gt;&gt;&gt; six.binary_type(2)

could someone explain it?"
1320,this is because of python3; in python2 bytes and str are the same; in python3 there are unicode strings and bytes and bytearrays are different
1320,"<@Porsha> does something like this make even sense?
```six.binary_type(str(0).encode())```"
1320,"<@Mirian> I could be wrong but I do not get what the point of doing this is?; six is for py2/3 compat, so you test for the two possible values of `six.binary_type`; and then proceed accordingly; or maybe I am missing the point"
1320,"In Python 2, `binary_type` is equivalent too `str`, in Python 3, it's `bytes`. They're defined and behave differently."

1322,well there need to be a link between the two if you want to pass the message

1322,"yeah, but i thought running that async would just let me to proceed; basically, i have a Bot() class that is doing something with the received message, a TestMachine() class which is generating a lot of bots with random parameters and an Interceptor() class which connects to the socket (so `connect_socket()` is part of Interceptor() ). i don’t want to pass the bot collection to the interceptor, and i dont want to create a socket connection for every bot…; if that makes sense; if it was js or something i could call the bot on the message receive event, but here i am stuck"

1333,"hmm, can you confirm that the image data is loading in your script?; maybe its coming in as a different format than the webcam?"
1333,how do i confirm?; here are the relevant lines
1333,logging; debugger
1333,or try recognizing somethign other than a face
1333,"`video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(""<http://192.168.1.2/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi>"")`; ```while True:

1333,"hmm; so, does that url require any kind of login?; or is it password protected?"
1333,"nope….; and when the script is running, there’s a cv2 window that’s open, and it shows the feed from the camera perfectly; it just never seems to detect any faces"
1333,interesting
1333,"and when i switch the feed to be my webcam, the exact same application works perfectly"
1333,do you know how to debug python?
1333,"not so much, im just getting started; should i get pycharm?"
1333,what I suspect is the feed from the IP camera is different in some way from the web camera; the cv2 window showing the feed probably knows how to handle the difference; but the face detection script doesn’t
1333,hmmm
1333,"so, in this case, an IDE with a debugger would probably help"
1333,interesting…..is there a way to convert the “read” frame into some other format?
1333,"short of that, put in logging statements in your face detector code"
1333,can u recommend an ide?
1333,"I like pycharm, and think you would get by fine with the free version; and as far as conversions, you would have to dig in the opencv documentation for that"
1333,"if you don't want to jump into an IDE right this moment, you can also insert python debugger statements and debug on the cmd line, if that somehow sounds preferable to you; otherwise, I second <@Meg>'s vote for pycharm"

1336,"Hey guys question. when defining a class, why does it need to have `self` in the methods?; for example: 
```class Dataset(object):
  def __init__(self, name, path, schema, type, prefix, primaryKey, separator='\t', header=None):
    self.name = name  # in format abacus_dataset_name
    self.path = path
    self.schema = schema
    self.type = type
    self.prefix = prefix
    self.primaryKey = primaryKey
    self.separator = separator
    self.header = header

  def show(self):
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('name = {}'.format(self.name))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('path = {}'.format(self.path))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('type = {}'.format(self.type))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('prefix = {}'.format(self.prefix))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('primaryKey = {}'.format(self.primaryKey))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('schema = {}'.format(self.schema))
```"
1336,`self` refers to the instance that's calling the class method
1336,why does show(self) need to be that way; Got it
1336,"it doesn't _have_ to be `self`, either; `def show(this):` works just as well; but you'll get weird looks"
1336,"the `why` for that is convention; coming from java, where `this` is the same as `self`, and is implicit to classes, was a big context switch for me"
1336,and the fact lots of java devs really _like_ that they can omit `this`
1336,also different from javascript in that `self` never changes what it points to. it's always the instance
1336,"yeah that’s something I like about Python - things like are usually more explicit, there’s less magic"
1336,we keep our magic contained inside of underscores
1336,heh
1336,I wonder how it would feel to find code where the author doesn't use `self` but something completely irrelevant; like `banana`
1336,"I have come across code where the author used other things than self, and it was jarring to say the least; it at least vaguely made sense"
1336,"<@Ciera> try it yourself for a day :smile:; on a branch, of course"
1336,no sure the code review will go ok :smile:

1337,"<@Max> you are effectively running a non-for-profit business with this idea, selling it, hoping for consumers, just no money.

1344,<@Myong> does it do the same thing on another linux system?
1344,I can't check at the moment it's the only Linux system I have; I tried `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`; Doesn't work with using `while True: time.sleep(1)`
1344,check to see if anything for `signal.getsignal(2)` return anythings beforehand
1344,Like so?
1344,"i believe so yeah, you generally just want to check that you're setup to handle a signal"

1346,Hello guys! any recommendations in dealing with time series data that has one insertion each day? I am currently using postgres and django
1347,"Hi all. I'm trying to write a loop along the lines of `for number in numbers`. Sometimes numbers will contain multiple values and be a tuple `('1', '2')` but other times it may just be a single number. When it's just a single number, python is splitting the number. Ie: 12 becomes `[1, 2]`. Does anyone know how to work around this issue?"
1347,you'd need to detect whether it's a number or tuple first
1347,Paste a small snippet of your code and the outupt :slightly_smiling_face:
1347,"```    # Parse parameters
    for param in sys.argv:
        if param.startswith('event='):
            event_ids = param.split('=')[1]

            # See if we have multiple event ids
            if ',' in event_ids:
                event_ids = event_ids.split(','); The code takes a parameter of event= where the value could be a single diget (ie: 21) or multiple comma separate digits (21, 22, 23 etc):
```
    # Parse parameters
    for param in sys.argv:
        if param.startswith('event='):
            event_ids = param.split('=')[1]

            # See if we have multiple event ids
            if ',' in event_ids:
                event_ids = event_ids.split(',')
```

Further down I want to loop over these, regardless of whether it's a single value or multiple:
```
    for event_id in event_ids:
        event = misp.get_event(event_id)
        print event
```

The problem is that if it's a single value (ie: 21) then python will split the string and instead loop over with a value of '2',  and then '1'."
1347,"you can use split on a string to get a list even if theres nothing to split on; ```In [1]: '21'.split(',')
Out[1]: ['21']

In [2]: '21,22'.split(',')
Out[2]: ['21', '22']```; so just always split the `event_ids` string and you'll be able to iterate over single or multiple values"

1350,Hey guys i have a newbie question is there a particular way we can  Execute multiple python files using a single main.py
1349,you can import them as modules and execute them that way
1349,"from path import x
from path import y"
1349,the python scripts would be in the same directory as the main.py would this cause a conflict ?
1349,as long as they aren't named something that takes precedence over another module
1349,"from yourmodule import x
from yourmodule import y; if same path"
1349,sounds good I'll give it a try

I was thinking if i could store the pem file in a DB. (May be Redis and read it from there). Add auth for redis and export the password as an environment variable. You guys have any feedbacks. Is it good bad or do you think it doesnt make much of a difference."
1365,do you have a lot of pem file ? or just one ?
1365,"I very much doubt that reading from Redis is faster than reading a file.; The file is going to be cached in RAM after the first access and remain there indefinitely, unless you don't have enough RAM"
1365,well if he only has one just load the file at startup and keep it in the python
1365,that's much better :slightly_smiling_face:
1366,maybe someone had read the book <https://pragprog.com/book/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest> ?
1367,<https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07F1KB2Q/p1510160730000266>
1366,"OK, I've been working on something and can't seem to get all the pieces together correctly.  The goal: Take a list of list of strings (results of a query from a SQL database), (hopefully) compress it, and ship it to an Azure blob storage as .tsv files.  All in memory.  The azure-storage library has a create_blob_from_stream option which I've successfully used to send a `io.BytesIO` stream (without compressing) and it works as intended, although I think it could be cleaned up.  Ultimately, I'm not sure I'm fully understanding the various pieces of the `io` standard library and want to get some suggestions on how to improve things.  I can't seem to get the compression working (tried zipfile and gzip) and I run into issue where I'll open(..., 'w') the GzipFile/ZipFile, write contents to it, but then can't send it to blob because it doesn't have read access (because I opened it with write to add to the compressed file?); Trying to keep it as lightweight as possible since it's going to be running on an RPi (hence the trying to avoid writing to disk aspect); The compression might be optional if the overhead of compressing isn't worth doing it (to lower the bandwidth), I was going to test doing it with/without and see if it was worth the tradeoff in time spent sending it to blob uncompressed vs compressed).  I can't imagine the overhead is a lot but I honestly have no clue and I'm trying to not prematurely optimize before needed.  Would love thoughts from anyone who's more familiar with this stuff"
1366,"so I guess my first question would be, does this work without compression?"
1366,"Yes.  It feels super hacky, and I'm not sure BytesIO is what I ultimately want to be using, but it works.; Everything I'm reading makes it seem like I should be using StringIO, but then I get a 'bytes' related error (after removing all the obvious byte things I'm doing in that snippet); Or maybe TextIOWrapper? That seems more like for loading from a file on disk rather than a stream"
1366,you could look into temporary files; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html>
1366,Doesn't that create temporary files on the disk potentially?
1366,"and is cleaned up after you close; so if you create it within a context manager, eg `with open(temp_file)`, it cleans up when the block finishes"
1366,"Is a potential option, except we don't want to write anything to disk at all unless we really have to.  Mostly because with RPi's will burn out the SD card with constant read/writes which normally isn't a problem with most applications"
1366,have you seen this?; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32794837/pass-io-bytesio-object-to-gzip-gzipfile-and-write-to-gzipfile>
1366,"I haven't, but i'm reading now; I think one of the things that I'm not sure how to handle is when you open a GzipFile and write things to it, how can you get read access to that GzipFile to do things like send it elsewhere?; Or maybe I have the whole process a little switched up.  Maybe I need to do something like open a stream `f`, with `gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, 'w')` add the relevant row elements to that Gzip, which maybe puts that compressed stuff into the stream f?; Right now I think I'm adding things to the stream, then somehow trying to zip it up after the fact; Ahahaha, that was it!; Something just clicked about streams"
1368,"Hi everyone, I'm using sqlite3 and I have a column I want to be unique. I've set the unique constraint on it so now I get an sqlite3.IntegrityError thrown when I try and add a duplicate item, which is what I want. 

Now I'm making a webscraper, and as I find new things to add to my db, I want to make sure they're not already in my db. My first thought is that I can just use a try/catch as my way of telling whether it's unique or not. My question is whether this is a good idea or not. I can't really articulate why, but it  just feels to me like this isn't really the intended use of try/catch and it's a bit hackish. Is using try/catch in this way a bad design choice?; I mean I can loop through the table or whatever and check like that, but it feels like that's going to be slower than the exception way"
1368,python philosophy is ask for forgiveness; A try/except is :thumbsup:
1368,"cool, thanks"
1369,"Hi guys, somebody have already did iterations about the values that are in the keys of redis ?; I've some messy values that need to cleanup"
1369,"As a followup to my earlier confusion about streams like `io.BytesIO`, when does this stream ""empty"" out?  I found myself reusing the same stream object over many iterations of a loop, but wasn't finding any issues even when using `seek(0)` about data being duplicated.  I'd rather be safe than sorry, but I'd like to understand it's behavior a little more"
1369,"as I understand it, when you do `seek(0)`, it moves the pointer to the 0th byte of the stream.  so when any writes happen, the bytes before that get overwritten; but conversely, it also means the bytes after still exist"
1369,"So what i'm doing currently is: write to stream, seek(0), then send that stream somewhere else (like azure blob in my case), then repeat for the next thing in my list using the same stream.  I'm not currently getting any duplicate data, but it feels wrong.  I think I'm going to switch it so it's using a fresh `BytesIO` object each time, since some initial googling tells me that making a new stream is just easier than worrying about reusing an old one"
1369,makes sense
1369,"Mostly it feels wrong because the next time I did seek(0) I would expect to see duplicate data (the stuff from the first iteration of the loop, plus the stuff for the current loop)"
1369,because the old stream will be garbage collected when all references don’t exist
1369,But I don't see anything from the old iterations so I assumed it was getting cleared or something at some point; This is the most likely explanation I think; thanks for the help <@Meg> :slightly_smiling_face:
1370,How do I check if a beautifulSoup item has any children?
1370,`findAll(tag_name)` returns a list; <https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#find-all>
1370,I have data where there are `&lt;p&gt;`  tags will be present sometimes with children and some times without children.; If there are children I want to get them else get the original tag
1370,"unfortunately, there’s no `has_child` method in BS"
1370,Will findall work even if I have no children
1370,you’ll have to test for it
1370,Ok; `soup.find_all()&gt;1`  seems to work
1371,"I want to find the immediate children of `&lt;body&gt;`. I don't want to find the sub-children of elements in `&lt;body&gt;`, but `soup.findall()` is finding everything and creating duplicates"
1370,I guess I could do `sound.find()` and get the siblings; But I'm having difficulty in finding a way to loop through all siblings; NVM .nextSibling is not working
1372,"how about 
```
for c in soup.body.children:
    has_child = True
    break
else:
    has_child = False
```"
1370,"NVM did
```
s_first = soup.find()

soup_list.append(s_first)
soup_list.append(s_first.fetchNextSiblings())

for s_next in s_first.fetchNextSiblings():
    print(""________________________----------------------------------_________________________________"")
    print s_next

```; Wouldn't that give the lowest elements and not the immediate children as I would want?; <@Gisele>; Had to remove head body and the extra div though. lol"
1370,I think soup.body.children give you immediate children of body
1370,"Thanks. It is `soup.body.div.children` for me; I'm getting navigable string error; My original code however works; ```
s_first = soup.body.div.find()

soup_list.append(s_first)
soup_list.extend(s_first.fetchNextSiblings())

for s_next in s_first.fetchNextSiblings():
    print(""________________________----------------------------------_________________________________"")
    print s_next




for s in soup_list:
    try:
        s.text
    except:
        print s
```"
1373,"```
for sc in soup.body.div.children:
    print(""___________________________________________________________"")
    try:
        print(sc.text)

    except:
        pass
```; Works too"
1370,It seems BS4 was auto converting some empty elements into navigable strings; Which were raising exceptions on printing
1370,"Has anyone here worked with tweepy? The tweets I'm trying to print keep getting cut off; Nevermind. I got it figured out. I need to use tweet_mode = ""extended"" parameter"
1373,"Will ```If re.findall(r""Q\d+"", sqa.text):``` be true only if there is a match?; Looks it is so; Since it is an empty list; I have the following code. It's not appending anything to the end list; I don't know why, but the list is empty; Seems the answer finding regex is wrong"
1374,I want to train a trained model on additional data without losing previously trained information on sklearn? any ideas?
1373,Works now. Changed the function order; Seems the `answer_found` `elif` was never called
1375,Does time.sleep block workers in celery?; I know it doesn't block threads; but workers?
1375,"yes, it does; at least in my experience; so, I have a group of tasks executing from a broadcast task of sorts; and once that group finishes, I need to run a cleanup task; ```
        aws_keys = AbstractIndexTask._get_keys(cl_id)
        task = SinglePageIndexTask()
        key_count = len(aws_keys)
        tasks = []

        <http://self.logger.info|self.logger.info>('[{}] keys to index for catalog [{}]'.format(key_count, cl_id))

        for idx, key in enumerate(aws_keys):
            tasks.append(task.s(cl_id, key, catalog_year, institution).set(queue = 'web_batch_index'))

        jobs = group(tasks).apply_async()

        while jobs.waiting():
            remaining_pages = key_count - jobs.completed_count()
            self.logger.debug('[{}] pages remaining'.format(remaining_pages))

        self.logger.debug('Indexing complete, starting verification')
        verify_task.apply_async(args = [cl_id], queue = 'validation')
```

this above handles the solr indexing for a fully mirrored US college catalog that we have on S3; that `sleep` in the `while` loop is blocking, so the controller task stays active until all the child tasks are complete"

1375,huh?  I think you better restructure your question because it makes no sense
1375,`a = eval(a)`; Not advised; But is that what you want?
1375,"I mean, you can do that, but highly not advised, as <@Fabiola> said; in other words, avoid at all costs :smile:"

1375,"I got something data from csv.

1375,<@Georgeann> are you using pythons in built csv library?
1375,yes
1375,so one of your columns has data that looks like an array?
1375,<@Georgeann> This. Do this. Don't use `eval`.
1375,<@Vada> I think json.loads solved my problem
1375,:+1:
1375,why `eval` is evil?
1375,Because it is arbitrary code execution

1375,"If you don't know what is going into the string you are analysing, someone could inject malicious code without you knowing.; you are analysing CSVs so this is very much the case"
1376,Needs an import
1375,"<@Georgeann> just so you know, _do not_ actually try the code <@Suellen> just wrote with eval :slightly_smiling_face:"
1375,my system will be deleted?
1375,modified it just in case someone is copypasting stuff into their terminal
1375,":stuck_out_tongue:; I was worried for a second that people would get all ""Oh what does this do?"" and try it"
1375,"haha, you really want to have a complete example here? :stuck_out_tongue:"
1375,"_for science_; Nah :stuck_out_tongue:; <@Georgeann> yeah the original would delete everything; json.loads parses it as if it is meant to be a json struture, which the example you gave is."
1375,"but, if I have windows?"
1375,so you get validation (fails if not an appropriate entry); and protection against injection :slightly_smiling_face:; <@Georgeann> they could write a windows specific command as well
1375,"<@Georgeann> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9383740/what-does-pythons-eval-do#9383764>

`eval` runs the string as python code. If the string is not written by you, someone could write malicious code and if would be run on your system."

1379,"Hi, I'm trying to make script compatible with multiple versions of the application. The newest version adds delete method to one of the classes. So I've created a fallback function that accepts the instance of that class and manually perform the actions. I am thinking of using it this way ```        delete_func = getattr(foo, ""delete"", _fallback_delete_function)
        delete_func()``` but it of course complains about `missing required positional argument`. Is there an easy way to attach that instance as the argument?"

1379,"actually not, when the method is found it complains that it `takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`; but works for the fallback function"
1379,hmm yeah my bad; `_fallback_delete_function` is not part of the class ?
1379,pure function with one argument
1379,the lazy way would be `delete_func(instance=foo)` and in `delete` just discard `instance`; of do an `if` / `else` with `delete_func(foo)` `delete_foo()` depending of the case

1389,"For context, what libraries are Auth() and Device() coming from?"
1389,they're classes I wrote; the auth class has some post and get methods; and the device class writes to a config file locally. I can upload a code snippet if it helps

1389,"I'll give it a try. when I run the code in through the debugger and step throught it, it runs fine. I'll add some prints and see what happens"
1389,how are you executing it when the errors happen?
1389,python script_name.py in the console
1389,"hmm, ok"
1389,"its like theres some async operation; ```
username = device.config.read('NAME')
password = device.config.read('PASSWORD')
key = device.config.read('SECRET_KEY')

registration = reg.register(username, password, key)
```; like that it works; w/e I'll stick with it."
1389,"hmm; so, what I suspect is the root cause is calling `reg.register()` in a `print` method; because as the documentation says 

&gt;All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does

<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print>; so what I suspect is the `str()` call is evaluating `reg.register()` first, before the actual arguments are evaluated"
1389,ohh i see.; I'll keep that in mind going forward
1390,"Is it printing anything from the statement on line 12?; But you probably would need to do `len(d.entries)` instead of just `len(d)`.  However the more ""pythonic"" way would be to just iterate through the links instead of indexing; like `for entry in d.entries`"
1390,"It's not printing anything from either print statement, but it was working prior to wrapping it in a function"
1390,Did you double check the length of `d`?
1390,"I just changed that to ""for entry in d.entries"" and it still doesn't print anything."
1390,Hmmm if you print d.entries before line 9 what is in it?; Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the library if that's the issue but assuming that `d.entries` is enumerable and contains some elements then print statement inside the loop should be executing; So just try iterating over d directly instead of entries?
1390,"I will try that; Tried it, didn't change it. At this point I'm just gonna say screw it and write all of the loops to append to my URL list  (since I have 4 RSS feed URLs) instead of doing it the 'right' way and using a function.; Thank you for your help."
1391,"So, at work we have a lot of apps/services each with their own `.env` files, a few repos have multiple. So naturally some of them have the same env variables. Which, can get convoluted. We use salt to set all the ENV's when deploying on production/staging but locally, its kind of a mess. 

What do you guys use, if any, to keep different versions of ENV vars in sync between apps based on the environment (prod, staging, dev)? I was considering proposing something like consul but not sure if theres anything simpler. It should be something that all the devs could easily setup and use.; those getting mixed up seem to be a reason some people have issues running some of the apps locally rather than using staging"

1392,"Thats all i get, when i google it i find case but they have problems with their context; I dont have any context"
1392,"A bit of context: a dictionary can be created from an iterable containing _pairs_ of values. Like `[(0, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4)]`.

Not sure if it's the 'right' way, but if I create a timedelta object i.e.  ```td = datetime.timedelta(hours=11)``` I can then minus that from the original. to get the UTC time.

1397,"<@Wonda> a timestamp has no notion of timezone. so it is in whatever timezone you are in essentially. though if you know you got it from someone with a -8 timezone, you could adjust it that way. without plugins, you could do what you did then change the time delta.

1401,How can I integrate React with Django? Which package is the best for the integration? I want to show model data to front-end.
1402,"Hey Peeps,
Have a question, I am parsing some json which looks like the following:
```
[{""id"": 0, ""title"": ""AAABBBCCC""}
{""id"": 1, ""title"": ""SSSBBBEEE""}
{""id"": 2, ""title"": ""KKKBBBFFF""}
{""id"": 3, ""title"": ""KKKFFFGGG""}]
```
This is stored as a simple list containing multiple dictionary objects. From here, my next step is to find an algorithm of some sort that can traverse through each title key in each dictionary and find similar or exact matches. If there are more than one matches or similar titles, then put the matches into a family, eventually yielding a set of family objects containing the matched tiles. With this in mind, if I execute the json listed above I expect to return:
```
['Set A': {""id"": 0, ""title"": ""AAABBBCCC""}
{""id"": 1, ""title"": ""AAABBBEEE""}] ,

['Set B': {""id"": 2, ""title"": ""KKKBBBFFF""}
{""id"": 3, ""title"": ""KKKFFFGGG""}]
```
Where both sets A &amp; B contain dictionaries where the title key values can be found by a) finding approximate substring matches inside a given string and b) finding dictionary strings that match the pattern approximately. I am thinking of incorporating an adaptation of some fuzzy matching algorithm, such as the Levenshtein distance Algorithm, but feel I could make this a lot simpler, does anyone have any alternative suggestions or ideas for me to look up? Would appreciate it greatly."
1402,"what I would do is make a class, and add in the id and title to the class on init.  Implement your comparison algorithm as a method.  eg, `def levenshtein` that takes in a string and returns the edit distance; so you can initialize a list of instances, and then filter it by the result of the edit distances"
1401,"They was a package highlighted in Talk Python to Me recently that does this exact thing and even more complex stuff like William for Bill and McDonalds and MCDONALD'S , bahhh!!!!, cannot remember the package.

1420,"Hey guys, I got a quick and probably simple issue at the moment. I'm writing a program to process .pcapng files to look at the packet data. The program has time frames which are given a timeout time. This timeout time is checked every time a new packet is read. The issue I'm having is, the .pcapng `timestamp` gives a pretty long float value which equates to a date obviously. For some reason, even after setting the timeout to also be a float, the loop goes a bit further than it should. The first packet in the timeframe sets the next time frame variable so that when `next_time_frame &lt;= timestamp` (this is the check I do every time a new packet comes in) a new next_time_frame is set and a I do other things. So for example if the first timestamp is 1385856000.00000, then `next_time_frame` would be 1385856060.00000, but for some reason, the loop doesn't stop when that statement is true.; So basically comparing two floats to each other isn't working properly"

1425,although you normally want to protect sensitive information especially for prod
1426,I'll explain more in <#C0LMFRMB5|django>
1427,"Have anyone here worked with bcrypt and postgres? I'm having trouble storing my hashed &amp; salted password in my postgres database using SQLAlchemy; Heroku logs aren't showing any useful info, works locally with sqlite3 though."
1427,it's best to replicate your production locally; i.e. use postgres for dev too
1427,I think it's a problem with the data type; Right now I'm using string
1427,"sqlite is very different, some thing might work in dev and not in prod, and others work in prod and not in dev"
1427,"I see that some people say here that you should convert the password bytes to a string first; Or using BYTEA; ""I had a similar problem and I solved it using BYTEA data type at the Postgresql. I think problem occurs while writing byte array into VARCHAR datatype in Postgre. This might be related to database encoding and the details of that conversion from byte to varchar.""; Could that be it?"
1427,I use db.String(64) or something; algorithm is bcrypt too
1427,Storing as bytea would almost certainly be more efficient.
1427,<@Joann> even if `bcrypt(something)` is a string?
1427,"Unfortunately, not all client libraries make that very easy."
1427,That's my usermodel; Then I have a db.py file
1427,"leovp: well, you'd ideally want to have it be a binary string since that's going to be smaller than a binary-string-encoded-as-text"
1427,and for making heroku work:
1427,"<@Joann> that's true, but unfortunately even low-level `bcrypt` returns a readable ascii string (or a bytes object, but still 2x the size); and other higher level libraries just use what they have been given; <@Carroll> looks ok, you really have to debug the issue itself"
1427,Yea
1427,i.e. what is the issue exactly?
1427,"I'm not sure, when I try to run this snippet; I have an endpoint /register"
1427,"your app complains about the password, or sqlalchemy? or underlying driver?"
1427,"leovp: which is terribly silly, really.  Still, you could at least save on-disk size by having the data type be a bytea and then sending the base64 or hex-encoded string to PG wrapped in a conversion function to turn it into a proper bytea."
1427,It hits the exception block; What message can I get out of e?; e.message wouldn't work
1427,"str(e), repr(e), anything really"
1427,Alright; Will deploy it and see what problem it is
1427,"Wouldn't help with network traffic since you'd be sending the hex-encoded string over the wire instead of the binary data, but saving space on disk and in memory is certainly valuable from a database perspective."
1427,otherwise it's really not clear
1427,"(the function you'd use for storing the data into a PG bytea would actually be 'decode', 'encode' would be used to pull the data back out)"
1427,"<@Joann> I guess no one in Flask/Django/etc world sees it as an issue, because a password column is rarely even 10% of a table size.
Maybe top players like Instagram do care, but I don't know"
1427,"eh, it just grates against me when people store binary data as text because it's such a waste of space."
1427,Uhm okey; dafuq
1427,The gitlab folks have made an effort to start storing their git hashes as bytea's because it really does make a difference in space.
1427,I understand you entirely :))
1427,oh my god; I think I get it; -.-; I'm a freaking idiot
1427,:tada:
1427,I changed the length of the db model; But never actually reset the heroku postgres database; ......; Any of you got a rope so I can hang myself?
1427,"leovp: With enough rows, every byte matters. :)"
1427,"I guess you would want to know that I store IPs in INET :slightly_smiling_face:; not as a string, which is _very_ common"
1427,"well, I'd probably recommend ip4r there; Though it depends on your requirements."
1427,:open_mouth:
1427,Would you look at that! It works :smile:
1427,Let me just google it
1427,"Right, now it's a problem with the auth :joy:"
1427,<@Joann> is it in 10.0 or 9.x?
1427,leovp: <https://github.com/RhodiumToad/ip4r>; It's an extension that works with lots of versions of PG
1427,I see. It's a bit harder to pitch
1427,"Unlike inet, it segregates ip4 vs. ip6, but it's much more efficient at storage and allows more indexing options"
1427,"I don't think INET is that bad currently, as we don't really perform operations on IPs frequently (or at all)"
1427,(an ip4 address is actually stored as a 32bit unsigned integer..)
1427,"And we do have a bunch ipv6 addresses stored, which would require `ipaddress` which is probably not much better than `INET`; still, good to know :slightly_smiling_face:"
1427,"well, or you could store ipv6 addresses as ip6 :); but, yeah, definitely something good to know about; and it's quite stable and well maintained."
1427,i.e. split each mixed IP columns into two?; that doesn't seem nice :confused:; or store ipv4 as a ipv6 as well? will postgres understand that `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:c0a8:10a` requires 4 bytes instead of 8?
1427,"Okey; <@Suellen> I'm really new to this crypto approach; This worked fine; Register now works; But, if we look in auth; Without encoding both, I got an error saying they must be encoded; So I encoded both with utf8, and I got this error message"
1428,Am I doing something obviously wrong here? :slightly_smiling_face:
1427,hm; where is this exception from?; `bcrypt.checkpw` returns true or false
1427,Exception is from the auth
1428,the bcrypt.checkpw
1427,"leovp: no, PG would store an ipv6 address as an ipv6 address"
1427,"<@Carroll> since you are doing utf8 going into the db, you don’t need to re-encode it after pulling it from the db"
1427,"leovp: You could have different tables rather than different columns, though it depends on your exact data model, of course."
1427,It raised an error when I tried to do that; Maybe I have to decode it?
1427,"leovp: I will note that storing NULLs are basically free unless you're careful to not have any NULLs at all in your tuples.; (in which case, PG can avoid storing the NULL bitmap at all)"
1427,<@Patty> I need that u?
1427,"<@Joann> This is just a bit too different, storing different types of addresses separately. :confused:; <@Carroll> I think the point was that `checkpw` doesn't raise an exception"
1427,"No you don’t need the u, that’s just demonstrating it’s a Unicode string "
1427,"leovp: eh, they actually are disjoint tho, really, but if it works for you.. :)"
1427,Sorry trying to get a snippet over but I’m in the middle of switching trains :)
1427,Hehe; I am using Heroku with Postgres though
1427,Are you still encoding the password before putting it in the dB?
1427,I am
1427,And did you clear out the original hashed value that wasn’t encoded?
1427,I did this
1427,Right but did you re-create the stored pw with that code?
1427,Yes; I registered a new user; Trying auth; Brb making noodles
1427,And just to check you redeployed your heroku app with the changes for creating hashes?
1427,I did
1429,"Hi, Python newbie here with probably a dumb question...  I am trying to use the Google API examples to get some code running that will send an email from my app since port 587 is blocked on the company network.  I am very close but I am running into some issues where the example code has included some logic for backwards compatibility with python 2.6.    I get compile errors because the syntax is incorrect inside an IF block.  I am coding on OSX with Python 2.7 and my IDE is LiClipse.
Here is the code in question and I get an error on the third line from the bottom where it wants ""tools.run(flow, store)"" to be ""tools.run_flow(flow, store)"" 
```     if not credentials or credentials.invalid:
        flow = client.flow_from_clientsecrets(CLIENT_SECRET_FILE, SCOPES)
        flow.user_agent = APPLICATION_NAME
        if flags:
            credentials = tools.run_flow(flow, store, flags)
        else: # Needed only for compatibility with Python 2.6
            credentials = tools.run(flow, store)
        print('Storing credentials to ' + credential_path)
    return credentials  ```
Any Ideas for me?; I went to get the compile error to post here and all of a sudden I am not getting an error on that line.  WTF?"
1429,"I guess my first question would be why support 2.6?; the last release of 2.6 was the .9 minor release back in 2013, and it hasn’t been supported since then"
1429,Does anyone here use Vim with YCM completer for Python?; I can't get the YCM Jedi to pick up my virtual environment python interpreter :disappointed:
1429,"well, if anyone is still running CentOS6, they've got 2.6; and it's semi-irritating to load a different version since the OS uses 'python' to run its package updater, and if it's not 2.6, it barfs.; I uh.... have a friend with that problem.... yeah."
1429,why would it not be 2.6?
1429,uhm that shouldn’t stop you from installing 2.7 or 3.x; just leave system python alone and create virtualenvs mapped to the specific python interpreter version
1429,running centos you can use the IUS repository (<https://ius.io/GettingStarted/>) to easily install python versions if you don't want to use the system default one
1430,"slightly off topic but relating to centos servers, has anyone managed to setup rdp onto a centos 6.8 server?"

My intention for the final version is that it will, from a gui, request input from the user, use that data to query sql, then dump the result in another gui window.; Am I headed in the right direction with this?; anything I should consider.

1431,"<@Sherice> Thanks for your suggestion but I am already able to extract the text but I am unable to save it to a Output.txt, the output of 1 pdf gets written instead of say 10 inside that directory."
1431,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open>; the `w` filemode truncates the file
1431,"<@Antionette> Thanks buddy, that helps"
1431,"how is pdfminer working for you?; there are two primary issues I have with it, but there really isn’t much you can do about it and really depends on the programs used for document creation; first, if you save the pdf document with an empty password, which happens sometimes with authoring programs, browsers and viewers will open it up, but won’t be able to read it; second, a small number of PDFs won’t be able to be opened at all, whereas they will open fine in other software; that’s my experience when I was processing 16k PDF documents consisting of about 25M pages of content for external text search; about 800 were unable to be processed at all due to those two issues"
1431,<@Season> what have you tried so far using argparse to add the arguments?
1431,"<@Antionette> I have just been googling and trying to combine the syntax in documents to what google provided but I honestly dont understand the code and the way each have been written dont match up.   For example I tried ot adapt parts of this example but I obviously didn't understand what I was doing because I coudlnt get it to work.  I have since thrown out my atttempts and put it back to how google had it so done really have specific examples of what I tried. ``` import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers.')
parser.add_argument('integers', metavar='N', type=int, nargs='+',
                   help='an integer for the accumulator')
parser.add_argument('--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const',
                   const=sum, default=max,
                   help='sum the integers (default: find the max)')

args = parser.parse_args()
print(args.accumulate(args.integers))  ```; I tried this portion with googles and it didnt work gave me errors. 

```  flags.add_argument('--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const',
                   const=sum, default=max,
                   help='sum the integers (default: find the max)') ```"
1431,"What could have been the issue there is that `flags` refers to the parsed arguments rather than the parser itself since the google code you posted has the `parse_args` function being called directly on the `ArgumentParser` instance, whereas you need to call `add_argument` on the parser itself.  So you could save the `ArgumentParser` to its own parser variable, then add your custom arguments, and then call the `parse_args` yourself rather than in the spot its called in google's example"
1431,<@Antionette> Thanks. Thats what I was trying to do but couldn't get it to work.  I decided to move on because calling it from bash isn't a requirement for today and I'm in a crunch.  When I get back to it I'll post my specific failing syntax.
1432,Does anyone know of any good references for installing a module to pip where I do not want to put it on pypi? I have some local config stuff built into a module and want to build it into pip to make pushing to production easier and more modular
1432,where will the module be stored?
1432,In my svn repo where I do my development locally in a modules folder. I wanted to pull that out and be able to have a separate repo for just private modules I might need across several projects
1432,`pip install svn+&lt;repo&gt;#egg=&lt;repo_name&gt;` usually
1432,"oh cool, that's way easier than I thought it would be; is that process of installing to pip locally called something that I can research into?; I don't have a decent understanding of how that all works and I'd rather learn more about it than just start doing something I don't fully understand"
1432,"you're not ever ""installing to pip""; pip is a tool for putting external python packages into a place in your PYTHONPATH; i'm not sure of a good resource other than just looking up something like `pip install git`"
1432,"That works, thanks for the help"
1432,<@Lory> <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#git>
1432,"Oh awesome, that's exactly what I needed"
1432,"I get all FOSS when I think of pip, it came to be to solve past issues, is in active development, isn't always the best, mostly does the trick, and one willll eventually run into an issue with it but one doesn't know until the tool doesn't do what is expected :slightly_smiling_face:"
1432,"be careful with the `-e` flag, especially if you use docker"
1432,"To be clear, it is currently *the* install tool for python"
1432,"i don't see it going away any time soon, especially once `Pipfile.lock` gets locked down"
1432,Yea I use it all the time ofr normal stuff within my virtualenv's I just have never packaged anything or gone farther than `pip install xyz`; Trying to take my development ability a little farther and actually understand pythons packaging system
1432,"you'll ""should"" be fine, some of the other flags like -user can also get you in trouble too"
1432,"`--user` is _usually_ pretty safe, at least on your local machine, assuming you're not using a virtualenv"
1432,is there ever a situation where you shouldn't use a virtualenv? Everything I've seen online says you should always use one; with the exception of random test scripts at least
1432,it makes no sense on single-purpose servers/containers
1432,Ah that does make sense
1432,"it's kinda useless for anything you actually want system-wide (like, say, `flake8`)"
1433,it’s not invoking as it needs to be `if __name__ == '__main__'`; it will error out then as `find_uncommon` isn’t defined
1434,Does anyone have experience decrypting files using `python-gnupg` on py3?
1435,"When I create a `RawPacket(buf[0:8], buf[208:280])` I get ```TypeError: object.__init__() takes no parameters```; which, as far as I can tell, is usually because people spell __init__ wrong, but I think I did it right here, anyone have a suggestion?"
1435,"weird, thats the normal super invocation; python2 or 3?"
1435,"2.7; oh wow, I forgot to put the module name in front. I gotta stop debugging at the end of the day; not sure how I ended up with that error tho"
1435,yeah that’s a bit of a mystery 
1436,What's up guys. I have a quick question. So I'm processing a large pcap file that so far has gone through 22 million packets. Now at some point the amount of data I need to collect is going to get way too large. I eventually have to store all the data I gather from this on a frontend webpage. Would sqlite be something to use?
1436,<@Myong> generally depends on how you're going to be using the data itself
1436,"So the idea is basically upload the data to a frontend (I'll probably use flask) and geolocate them using a database we've been given.; the frontend is supposed to feature an interactive map; Geolocating victims of DDoS attacks that is.; But for now, the file is so large I'm not sure how long it should actually take to go through the whole 8GB file...; So it takes about 1 minute 54 seconds to process 15 minutes worth of packets"
1436,off the top of my head i'd probably go for PostGresQL; + postgis
1436,I'm just trying to figure out what the tables should look like
1436,i usually try and put together a few user stories to try and map out my data tables
1436,<@Marcie> About to put together an example on paper and draw out what might be the best option.
1437,My only concern is how detailed these things have to be. If all they need to be are IPs that map to locations and like 3 other columns of integers then it will be easy cause I can make a single table; So the basic structure that I currently have in python is this.
1436,<@Marcie> Just drew this up. I have no clue if this is valid or a good diagram. But it gathers all the information I need
1437,"Actually, realizing the circular reference is gonna be horrible. Scratch that table; Alternatively I could simply remove the Attack Time Frame since I can query the DDoS Victims table for timeframes between a specific time; Guess this problem is a bit more difficult than I thought as far as what I know is concerned."

- which is better?
- is there a pep8 or other style guide link identifying which is better?"
1441,hmmmm really?  that seems kind of odd for it to live “outside” of the else block it describes; i guess the extra line break does group it along with it though

1443,anyone familiar with how I can connect to a named VPN (openvpn) network that shows in my NetworkManager VPN list from the cli?
1441,on Ubuntu
1441,"if it’s down to personal preference though i’m probably going to go with what my boss asked for, which is the first example I posted; if there’s specific language in pep8 about it he’d be more than happy to bow to that, but i don’t see it"
1443,"The big thing from PEP-8 what I gave as an example enforces the idea from the PEP to `use inline comments sparingly`; Also, IMO, doing it to extend the length of a row of logic flow reduces readability"
1441,yeah I totally agree with the latter.  And I agree about “sparingly” but that has a degree of subjectivity :slightly_smiling_face:
1443,I think you are going to need to ~copy and edit~ extract the existing vpn-related part of your network in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/your_name` to a file and then use `openvpn --config your_file`
1441,"I also dislike the first example <@Sade>, in this particular case"
1443,But if you are being told what to do why even ask?
1441,Submit to their style :pray:
1443,<@Ronny> yea i found some example on that. now trying to get the auth working
1441,"That being said I don't think it is egregiously bad, even if it isn't the best"
1441,"well, my boss prefers the first one, but he’s not strongarming me about it.  I just like to go with the flow unless I can find a pep8 or other authoritative style guide backing me up, otherwise I assume it’s a matter of taste"
1441,"In this situation it is taste, PEP8 has a preference, not a rule.; But you can spin that how you want :wink:"
1441,"i much prefer to stick to pep8, but even I dont stick to all the rules. line lenght for example.; its nice to use it as a default, the tweak the things you need. that way you still have a set guideline"
1441,"I'm running into issues with Pandas when combining `.cut()` and `.count_value()` due to bins not actually being present as values in the data. 
The snippet below shows a workable example. Basically what I'm trying to get is a simple bar plot:
```
  |
  | |         |
|-----|-----|-----|
  A I   A I   A I
  0-10 10-20 20-30
```
The OS distributions are shown within percentage bins, and bins should be shown even if there's no data for them.
In the snippet I've used `pd.cut()` on the percentage data to get a nice categorical column. I group this data using `groupby` and then I want to get the counts for each OS using `value_counts()`. This is where the code crashes, seemingly because (in the sample data) only 4 out of 21 bins are actually present.
The results based on the rounded up data do show that in theory it does what I need it to.
Any way I can easily get around that crash?"
1444,"quick question,  can someone explain the th [‘name’] at the end of this syntax works?  It works perfectly but I want to get the address data too and didnt wan to make a second api call because its slow.

1444,Do you understand the rest of it?; That's a nice example of where f-strings make things easier to read.
1441,"Side note: You want to use `==` with strings, not `is`, or you risk some very unexpected behaviour.; Explanation: `is` compares object identity, not equality, so it only works ""by accident"" in common paths when strings resolve to the same actual string object due to interning, and will break if you get strings through different paths.; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'abc' == 'abc'.lower()
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'abc' is 'abc'.lower()
False

1444,"<@Meghan> Yes up to that point I do. I’ll look up f-strings; So say i wanted to do this in one line and one api call…
```

device_address = json.loads(session.get('<https://dashboard.meraki.com/api/v0/networks/>' + device['networkId'] + '/devices/' + device['serial'], headers=headers).text)['address']
 ```; I can look it up. Im just not sure what this feature is called when the [‘name’] is added to the end of the line"
1444,"`json.loads` decodes json, so with your example you could do
```
device_info = json.loads(session.get('<https://dashboard.meraki.com/api/v0/networks/>' + device['networkId'] + '/devices/' + device['serial'], headers=headers).text)
name = device_info['name']
address = device_info['address']

1446,"This may be a stupid question, but how do I keep homebrew on OS X from constantly installing python as a dependency? I already have python installed from anaconda.; And - more generally - how do I clean up my Python install on Mac OS? I have no idea exactly how many versions of python I have installed on here, where they’re located, and how to remove all of them so I’m only left with the base Mac version, so I can start from a clean slate?"
1446,"I'm not sure about your first question, but as far as your second question, through the terminal you can type `which python` and `whereis python` while also using tab to auto complete differing versions to find out where they are installed globally. If you're using virtualenv's, those commands won't be able to pick up the venv's install paths unless you currently have them activated; that's where I would start at least"
1446,"I’m using raw bash - that should get around any virtualenv issues, yeah?; by “raw” I mean just out-of-box bash."
1446,"virtualenv is independent of your shell, if you haven't personally installed any then they probably don't exist on your machine; in which case don't worry about them"
1446,"Ah. I don’t recall installing any - would some python tools (PyCharm, Anaconda, etc) install a virtualenv?; I’ve screwed around with Python on and off over time, and my system has accumulated a LOT of weird junk because of that."
1446,"honestly not sure, I would presume they probably do but you wouldn't want to mess with those unless you're also uninstalling the software that uses them; in which case you can probably just use OSX's uninstall stuff to delete the software and they'll clean up after themselves"
1446,I literally only have PyCharm installed - that’s the only Python IDE I have installed right now. And if I recall correctly I can set it to use whatever Python version I have installed.
1446,I have not used OSX in years so I'm not sure of the exact procedure for uninstalling software packages
1446,"The problem is, I’ve done things like `brew install anaconda`, and OS X has no method to clean that up.; With OS X, it’s drag package to trash, OS cleans everything else up."
1446,"I would start by deleting pycharm then, and then running those commands I sent earlier"
1446,man brew is your friend
1446,someone else would probably know better though; if you want to get rid of pycharm that is
1446,"<#C6E28H1HV|os_mac> may be of assistance, can't say how active it is"
1446,packages installed with brew can be uninstalled with brew and deps pruned etc
1446,"I do want to use PyCharm - however, I don’t think it installs anything Python-related, just uses whatever’s on the system.; I ran brew prune earlier, looks like I only have a pretty minimal set of brew packages installed right now.; So apparently anaconda messes with .profile, the .bashrc equivalent on Mac; holy crap, I still have npm garbage on here."
1446,"`.profile` is a UNIX thing, it's not Mac-specific, and it's not exactly equivalent to `.bashrc` in terms of history/what reads it; But unless you care, I wouldn't bother reading more than just knowing that for now"
1446,you have no idea how much I care :smile:

1446,"I legit am interested in getting elbows-deep in the Unix-y bits of MacOS; I’m just not sure what bits are common to all Unixes and what bits are MacOS, which results in some confusion"
1446,"And I don't know anything about OSX, so when I see something I do know, it's obviously UNIX/Linux"
1446,"there ya go!; So if there’s something that a Unix/Linux person doesn’t recognize, e.g. a .DS_Store, that’s Mac stuff."
1446,All I know about DS_Store is I sometimes get it in downloads and it makes me angry; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1446,"it’s a Mac thing, I believe it contains tagging information for the Mac file system - equivalent to the Windows desktop.ini that pollutes everything."

The question I have is, how exactly should I deal with creating  and opening the session? Should I persist the connection through the whole time the program runs as well as the session object? Or should I close the session/connection when it's not needed?"
1449,"<@Myong> you should generally keep the connection open but as for sessions, it can vary. depends on if you want to use session vs. transaction scope, or sometimes its kept around the length of a transaction (say, a request on an API); SQLAlchemy has a good writeup of making the decision for scoping sessions here: <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_basics.html#session-faq-whentocreate>"
1449,"I actually just finished reading that same article. Its pretty much what I thought but I wasn't too sure.; I am wondering though, should I instantiate the session in my `__init__.py` then use it from there or on creating of my main class object (which essentially manages the whole program) set something like `self.session = Session()`; <@Patty> The transactions seem like they'll probably be occurring every 1 second. Not sure how long it takes to do all the database inserts to add the objects as of yet. I'm just trying to figure out the best approach."

1451,"<@Ronny> the error isn't in `requests`, but (much likely) in your system-wide openssl"
1451,"yeah my guess might be openssl version, but it’s just a guess; also - when you say “randomly” do you mean randomly within the same domain, or for random particular domains (so in that sense, not really randomly)"
1451,"Randomly within the main domain...I say randomly because I download about 10-20 files with this code and it fails in a non-consistent manner; sometimes with the 5th or so, sometimes at the first, sometimes not at all; I also tend to favor your hypotheses regarding the specific openssl configuration (btw, it's just a regular ubuntu).
At my personal laptop, I tinker configurations here and there and I imagine that I had changed something that I shouldn't have from the openssl or ca-certificates packages
However, at this new machine that is now failing as well, I touch nothing, it's a regular Ubuntu 16.04 machine"
1451,"what do your coworkers have?; also, other things that can affect ssl type things - any weird issues with your clock?"
1451,mmm haven't thought about clock issues before
1452,"Hi, I have to make a file downloadable in a wagtail project. The PDF file is uploaded in the admin and then it should be downloadable. If you have a best practice I would appreciate it!"
1451,<@Ronny> you can tell requests to ignore ssl verification
1453,<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification>; use `verify = False` with `requests.get(...)`; what you probably want to use is the geojson serializer; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/gis/serializers/>; or check this out; <https://github.com/makinacorpus/django-geojson>

1454,"<@Virgen> i think it really depends what you're looking for. django is probably going to be easier to start out with, unless you've already got pretty strong python skills and web development experience with (insert large established framework here). i'd say there's more extensions, more tutorials, a livelier community around django. it's also got some established conventions for how things are done (more or less) and that can help a lot if you've got a team. all that said, flask is great - it lets you build exactly what you want without all the extra batteries you might not need. (but as your project gets bigger, i think you'll discover that actually hey a lot of those things are going to be needed, and you'll end up needing to research and integrate a solution in flask). but, you spend a month building up a flask app vs a django app, and while you'd probably get further on the django app, you're also going to have a much deeper understanding of how flask works compared to the ""magic"" of django"
1454,"<@Jaquelyn> Thank you for the response. I think I might head the django direction. In short, I am looking to get as much functionality as quick as possible.

1455,"Hi All! :wave: 
I have what I believe should be an easy task, but am having a rather difficult time understanding. It is regarding dependencies installed via `pip`.
I installed tensorflow a while back (version 1.0.0), but now want to upgrade to `1.1.0`. I have this code snippet (`tf_version.py`) that prints the current version of tensorflow:
```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```
When I run `python tf_version.py` in the terminal I get `1.0.0`. However, when I run `pip uninstall tensorflow` I get:
```
Cannot uninstall requirement tensorflow, not installed
```
Where could this dependency be hiding?"

1455,macOS 10.13.1
1455,"I only know *bash, but let's try this."
1455,do you need authentication?
1455,What happens when you type `which pip` and `which python` into your shell?
1455,do you need to paginate the search results?
1455,`/usr/local/bin/pip`
1454,"<@Junita> auth, negative. it will be internal only."
1455,paginate... not sure...
1455,`/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/python`
1455,"Ok, thought that might be the case ^^"
1455,if it’s just a simple query and display I’d actually say Flask would probably be quicker to get you up and running.
1455,"I'm not an expert, but it looks like you `pip` and `python` are in different distributions, and that's causing the issue"
1455,"it’s the bells and whistles like auth, pagination, database models, etc where Django can really help you by guiding you in what to do"
1455,Because of a conflict in paths
1455,well that's farther than I got!; Thanks <@Fabiola>!
1455,I surprised that it picks up one and not the other
1455,in the end though I honestly don’t think you can go wrong either way
1455,Do you have a file called .bashrc in your home directory?
1455,yeah
1455,does it have a line in it added by anaconda?
1455,"If you have any local resources, like friends or coworkers who have experience in either one, that’d be a good way to prioritize which to choose"
1455,"for pagination, I think I would really only need the main page and limit the number of results."

1455,"no it doesn't; hmm, i may have accidentally removed it; if it was supposed to be there"
1455,Interesting ^^ I think it's an option to put it there automatically when installing anaconda
1455,"hmm... I'm torn. I think I might go with django. I dont have any local resources for assistance. My understanding is that django has the more significant web community.; and, if this is successful, I may start looking for other tasks that I can simplify by building a simple webapp, when that time comes, if I need some of those features you talked about in django, I would rather build on existing knowledge than learn django after having figured out flask..."
1455,"Do you want to do a bit of deeper troubleshooting, or do you just want to get on with other stuff right now?"
1455,"it might, although I’m not sure the difference would be significant enough to matter.; yeah that sounds like a good plan; django definitely has a little more of a learning curve than flask, but it’ll shine when you get into intermediate level stuff"
1455,thank you for the info! I do appreciate it!
1455,"Essentially: you want to be installing stuff using `/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/pip` instead of `/usr/local/bin/pip`, because the different `pip`s will install the packages to different places. If you try `/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/pip uninstall tensorflow` it should work. And in future you want to be using the anaconda pip, not your system pip, because you're using the python interpreter installed by anaconda, which will look for packages installed in the place the anaconda `pip` uses, which if why you could run that file without trouble before"
1455,np
1455,"In the future, rather than always writing `/Users/danilo.../pip` when using `pip` you can modify your `PATH` environment variable so that it points at `anaconda/bin` before `usr/lcoal/bin`; Anther consideration for the future is that when doing projects you can create virtual environments, either using `conda` (<https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html>) or virtual envs (<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>). That way, each project will have it's own packages and dependencies. So you can use `tensorflow 1.0.0` for one project, and `tensorflow 1.2.0` for another. That way, code you wrote a year ago will still run. It takes a little bit more thought to manage, but it's worth it, in my experience; I prefer `conda`, because it's better for things like `scipy`, `numpy`, etc.

Oh, and I think to fix your `PATH` variable you could put a line like `export PATH=""Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin:$PATH""` in your `.bashrc` but I'm not sure. You can try and delete the line later if it doesn't work!; To see what your `PATH` currently looks like, I think you can write `echo $PATH` in your shell"

1472,"Hello everyone! I’m working on my very first data science project and had some questions regarding the amount of data that I use… I have two large datasets from the US dept of Justice and Kaggle, both with info about student earnings post-graduation from every major university in the US. Unfortunately, the metrics in one data set is not the same metric used as the Kaggle data set (I wanted to use the same time metric’s).. How should I go about this issue? Should I work on converting one data set metric to the same metric that i’m using..? Or should I only use the data that fits the time metric? As this is my first data science project, i’m kind of leaning towards the idea of just not using some of the data :disappointed: *any* help is useful, thank you everyone!"

I have: 1 server with few different python applications and I need to set up jobs in airflow for all of them
questions:
1. what would be the best solution - use `airflow` instance per project(requirements.txt for a project) have 1 separate instance and configuration for jobs from all project in this repo
2. If 1 instance per project - there is a problem, that some of of tasks(from different projects - Task1 from project A, taks 4 from project C) resource consuming so there is an idea to group them and run only after each other - then you can’t do it when you have instance per project
3. if 1 separate instance for all projects - you have dependency with all commands paths for projects(`/var/projectA/run.sh`, `/var/projectB/run-123.sh`) and deploy changes becomes a bit tricky
sorry for these nubes questions, `airflow` smth new for me :slightly_smiling_face:"

    {""Network"": ""net2"", ""Device"": ""222222""},
    {""Network"": ""net3"", ""Device"": ""333333""},

]
```
And I want the value for device for net2… Is there a way to quickly look that up without having to iterate through it?"
1480,nope; unless `net2` is always the second in the list
1480,<@Patty> so I have to loop is what you are telling me?
1480,Yep; unless the `Device` you want to get at `net2` is _always_ second in the list
1480,no I cant say that for sure
1480,"Okay, then yep, you’ll have to loop through it"
1480,"I am comparing to find when a previous value in the “list of dictionaries” :slightly_smiling_face: changes, so I will be looping 700 rows and then needing to loop up-to 700 times for each comparison.  Is there a better way I can store that data that would allow me to look up the values more efficiently?"
1480,"Are the network names unique? If so you can store it as a dictionary keyed to the network name with the value as the device name; And I don't think this changes anything because when you're working with it then its probably a list of dictionaries but as is it looks like valid json besides the trailing comma; Hmmm I'm pretty sure the top level can be either an object or an array, possibly any valid json value as well"
1480,"yeah nevermind i was loking at something different, i shouldnt be doing like 15 things at once; anyway, my brain being elsewhere aside, to echo <@Antionette> if the network names are unique put it all in a dictionary, lookup is much more performant; (or if the devices are unique)"

1482,"the short version is that 'str' in py3 is a unicode object, 'str' in py2 is a byte array object; if you have a unicode and you want a bytestring, use `.encode(_dialect_)`, if you have a bytestring and you want a unicode, use `.decode(_dialect_)`; and uh, be mindful of what is what, because it is a difficult bug to fix; it appears you need some additional logic to handle url bytes, probably substituting funky characters into % codes and that sort of thing.

You can call `my_func` keeping the `arg2` default value but changing `arg3` like so: `my_func('value_arg1', arg3=789)`; But `arg1` is always required since it doesn't have a default value (the `=something`) in the function's signature"

1491,would anyone know how to dynamically update an option menu based on what is selected in another option menu in python?
1489,<@Lilliam>Dynamically in your HTML or before rendering the template?
1491,not using html im in an IDE coding a GUI with option  menus
1491,<@Lilliam> It would depend on what GUI framework(if any) you are using. If you are using PyQT for example it can be done using signals and slots

1495,well then parse the dict into a json string; that way you just read the value
1495,not familiar with json; there is no way just to do it in python

1509,"hey guys; So i am new to python, I am on linux and i seem to have python (v2.7) and python3 preinstalled; when i open my vscode IDE it tries to install a bunch of things like my linter (which will run the commands against the /usr/bin/python binary and not the v3 one); Am i supposed to change the symlink on my install if i want to use python3?; Or do i have to upgrade the default version? Or what do i do?"
1509,before installing anything you should check out virtualenv; you don't want to install stuff on your system python as it's widely used by other tools
1509,I see.. so it isolates it for your project; basically like NPM / Composer so you have your dependencies for your project only?
1509,yeah exactly; depending on your system you might also want to compile the latest python `3.6.3` so you can learn with the newest; there are multiple tools that can help you with that. I would recommend `pyenv` or `pythonz`
1509,"so wait.. i dont even know what all those things are yet.. i want to run a python script and now i hear about virtualenv, pip, pyenv, pythonz; pythonz is like nvm?"
1509,If you just want to run a python script you can easily run it with your system python. Then if you need to install dependencies you should use a virtualenv that split dependencies per project and you use pip to install the modules you need; What you can also do is install other version of python if you want to develop on them. Theses version should be installed alongside your system python because replacing it could cause some bugs for your system
1509,I see.. but what do i point to in my python scripts? #!/usr/bin/env python ?
1509,If you are on a recent linux your python3 version should be at least `3.5.x`. There is now python `3.6.x` but it doesn't changes a lot of things especially if you are a beginner; I believe `#!/usr/bin/env python` is correct but I usually don't put a shebang so I'm not sure
1509,Well if i want to use v3 for it (any 3.* version should be compatible with any v3 version if python follows semver) So would i target python3?
1509,if your script only run on python3 yes; usually python without version point to python2
1509,I see..; So what is pyvenv? the pythonz docs point to it if python &gt;= 3.3; I want to use the latest version of python.. so definitely &gt;= 3.3
1509,If you build on python3 I personally recommend aiming compatibility for python3.5 and up; but then it can depends on what you are doing
1509,Why does it matter if i use 3.4 or 3.5 or 3.6? Shouldn't they all work with python3
1509,they are all forward compatible but 3.5 and 3.6 brings new features that aren't supported on older version
1509,that sounds like it is not  forward compatible at all if they aren't supported; That they have new features should be obvious (hence the version bump)
1509,well a new feature in 3.5 is not supported in 3.4
1509,Yeah of course; so having in mind that i want to use python &gt;= 3.3; And i already have installed pythonz and my pthon 3.6.2 is ready to go; whats the next step for me here? Do i install virtualenv or venv (Which seems to be the new thing since python 3.3?)
1509,you can create a virtualenv with `/path/to/python -m venv path/to/env`; and then activate it with `. path/to/env/bin/activate`
1509,"""/path/to/env"" is my directory? like a npm project directory?; and the path/to/python is just any python version? Or do i have to use the pythonz binary path)"
1509,paht to env is the path to the env direcory. So usually your/project/.env; and you need to use the python executable of the version you want your env to be in
1509,so in my case pythonz locate 3.6.2
1509,yep
1509,So i did this and it created a pyenv.cfg file and a bunch of folders; So following the docs from <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments>; i activated the environment with source ./bin/activate; and now executing the script which was targeting python now outputs v3.6.2; so that seems like a good start
1509,now you can `pip install stuff` safely without risking to mess your system python :thumbsup:
1509,And if i change projects i pretty much do the same there but then activate the other project and install stuff there via pip
1509,yes
1509,So why did you point me to virtualenv in the beginning? Did you assume i was using a python version below 3.3? or is there some additional benefit of using it?
1509,"I'm just used to say virtualenv. They are all the same things, it's just the way to create them that changed"
1509,"ahh i see..; i am getting a bunch of errors trying to pip install things; first of all i installed setuptools using sudo pip install setuptools; and it gives me ""Requirement already satisfied: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"""
1509,you shouldn't need to `sudo`
1509,which does not really sound like it is inside the virtual env?; that gave me a permission error earlier without sudo
1509,and are you sure your env is activated ?
1509,"it says ""(python_test) name@name-pc ~python_test $; so it sounds like it is correct; but the fact that it points to 2.7 doesn't sound right, does it"
1509,can you do `which pip` ?; and `python --version`
1509,but return the correct thing; python_test/bin/pip and v3.6.2
1509,"anyone here good with matplotlib, specifically the FuncAnimation aspect?"
1509,can you do `pip install requests` and copy the error here if you got one :slightly_smiling_face:
1509,"when i run  pip install pyside Command ""python setup.py egg_info"" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-z7ojhvbi/pyside/; It downloaded and installed everything successful; but running pip install pyside still gives me the same error"
1509,that might be a problem with pyside then; I'm not really familliar with it :confused:
1509,"""Both PySide source and binary packages for all supported platforms are available from the Python Package Index (PyPI). Thanks to this, PySide can be downloaded and installed using `pip` installer. """
1509,can you do `pip install -U pip setuptools`; it will update pip and setuptools and then retry
1509,"Requirement already up-to-date: pip in ./lib/python3.6/site-packages; Successfully installed setuptools-38.1.0; Ahh i totally didn't see this output.. i just noticed the red error; but it clearly says ""    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    only these python versions are supported: [(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)]""; My bad"
1509,that explains that :slightly_smiling_face:; I'm not sure what pyside does but there might be some more uptodate packages out there
1509,they seem to have binaries for pyside too; <http://wiki.qt.io/PySide_Binaries_Linux>; But i was going to try this and just use python 3.4

1517,"Question; I'm helping someone out with a homework problem, and their teacher/textbook has them naming class attributes with double underscores. What is the purpose of this?

for example we have a class Nation:
```
class Nation:
    def __init__(self, name, continent, population):
        self.__name = name
        self.__continent = continent
        self.__population = population
```; What does the double underscore do here? I know it does something because when I create an instance, I can't access the attributes with .__name; I have to access with ._Nation__name; What is the purpose of this?"
1517,"__double_leading_underscore: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, __boo becomes _FooBar__boo; see below).

__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__: ""magic"" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. __init__,  __import__ or __file__. Never invent such names; only use them as documented.; Not sure if this helps; Naming an attribute in your class self._var1 indicates to the user of the class that the attribute should only be accessed by the class's internals (or perhaps those of a subclass) and that they need not directly access it and probably shouldn't modify it. You should use leading underscores in the same places that you would use a private or protected field in Java or C#, but be aware that the language doesn't actually enforce non-access - instead you trust your class's user to not do anything stupid, and leave them the option of accessing (or modifying) your class's private field if they're really, really sure that they know what they're doing and it makes sense.; I wondered the same thing a while ago. Quite a good answer here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301346/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-single-and-a-double-underscore-before-an-object-name>"
1517,"Based on the assignment, and the textbook, it looks to me like the class is heavily influenced by Java/C# principles that aren't really relevant in python; What is the purpose of ""Name Mangling""?; Ah, nevermind. I think I see it here in pep8; To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.

Python mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an attribute named __a, it cannot be accessed by Foo.__a. (An insistent user could still gain access by calling Foo._Foo__a.) Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed.; avoiding name clashes with subclasses"
1517,Still learning myself. I think it's a way of protecting certain class attributes
1517,"Yea, I've heard of using a single _ to note that it should only be used internally; Kind of silly in the context of this assignemnt, imo"

1543,"<@Lilliam>I think we just had this issue come up the other day in here. The problem is that you are calling `self.update_options()` before you create `self._optionmenu_b`, so it doesn't actually exist yet even though you are retrieving it in the `update_options` function; The solution is probably one of a.) don't touch it in `update_options`, b.) call `update_options()` after creation of your menus, c.) change your design to not need to do things in that way; to be more specific, line 19 seems to be the most immediate culprit"
1543,<@Sirena> thanks is there any other way to update an option menu based on what is selected in another option menu?
1543,"hard to say without knowing more, but probably you should create some kind of empty or default menu stuff in the __init__ before you call the other functions, as it sits currently you have a circular dependence; so I don't think it's impossible to update a menu based on a menu; but you can't update a menu based on unknowable information for sure; you might be able to just move #19 down to #25 and have it work, there's a lot going on here that I'm not terribly familiar with; I don't do much GUI or DB stuff, sadly"

1548,`root.findall('GetOrderStatus')`; assuming you’ve already loaded the xml response in `root`
1548,"That didn't work, but I think I've found a solution; Because I what to be able to find the tag wherever it may be in the xml hierarchy, I need to prepend the XPath with `.//` which means start from the current (root) node and then subsequently search all sub-elements."
1548,"uhm, `findall` shoud do that for you, provided you have the correct tag name; &gt;&gt;&gt;findall(match)
Finds all matching subelements, by tag name or path. Returns a list containing all matching elements in document order.; since `GetOrderStatus` is a tag name, you should return a list of element size one"

1559,"<@Gerri> I'd find the first unmatched bracket using vim, and use that as a reference point for the other unmatched ones.; the other thing I'd recommend is that if you are having trouble keeping track of your segments within a template it's a good idea to break up the template into multiple parts. You can trick jinja2 into multiple inheritance through `extends`, `include` and `import` which allows you to do things like template segments for header, footer, if say it's a separation aggreement you'll have a section that waives liability of the lawyer on almost every divorce document so you can create a standard template for this.

1563,"oops, just noticed this thread. I think so yeah, but if you write Europe/Amsterdam, it might return `Europe/Amsterdam` as the timezone rather than CET. I think a lot of those timezone fields are not super standardized so it depends what libs are underneath, and I only really have experience on the Linux side of those libs. No idea what it does in Windows/other. Might be the same, might not. If you're especially concerned about it, you might use datetime to fetch the GMT offset and then convert to time zone codes yourself. If it's not especially critical you can just leave it to the library"
1565,Not sure for what project of your it is <@Jesusa> but my initial approach would be to trust datetime or others date library and investigate if you get bugs
1563,"you may find this reference useful. It looks like CET is used for standard and daylight both, as is Europe/Amsterdam, and they are the same values for GMT offsets; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones>"
1565,<@Ciera> yea I was thinking that's the easiest way... though for creating an automated trading sytem i prefer not to deliberately wait for known potential bugs :slightly_smiling_face:
1563,"<@Sirena> linux here too, and i also considered a GMT offset, but the problem is that I think that's the actual one that might change. maybe if i could mock changing the system time, I could figure it out?"
1563,"I think that in general it's going to work fine with either CET or Europe/Amsterdam; it sounds like CET is technically deprecated but still supported; and for a trading system, yah you'll definitely want to mock it and check a bunch of boundary cases"
1563,"Give me a minute, I'm checking things out."
1566,"First off you have two statements: ``` if line.startswith(""Alternate: ""):

1563,Do you mean to redine `mode` *after* using it in `role[mode] = buff.strip()`
1566,"<@Winnie>; Without seeing what your data looks like this is a bit more readable; I could also combine these lines ```
for line in file:
    # if line starts with alternate save the normal description
    if line.startswith(""Alternate: ""):

    elif line.startswith(""2nd Alternate: ""):
        role_dictionary[alt2_mode] = build_line(line, len(alt2_mode))``` into a single if check by changing the `alt_*` values into a dictionary but that's a little bit more advanced."

1572,"hey folks. I've got some dates in my db stored as `""Wed Nov 29 2017""` and a form submitting dates as `29 November, 2017`. I can't change the format of the form submission. How would you go about converting the form dates to match the dates in the DB?"
1571,"timedate is about to be your friend, I think; or datetime even; apparently my brain is wrong-endian today"
1571,Looking through the docs now :face_with_rolling_eyes:
1572,<@Corrinne> also maybe look into storing dates as `dates` instead of `strings`
1571,"`dt.date(2017, 11, 29).strftime('%d %B, %Y')`; will probably get you close, after you figure out entering your month correctly"
1572,Was thinking maybe i could split the form date and re-arrange it to query the db :thinking_face:
1572,what DB are you using
1572,mongodb + mongoengine
1571,"@julian haven't worked with mongo in a while, but it supports date types (<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/Date/>) and pymongo appears to allow queries against dates: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/26366914/1948982>"
1571,"`dt.datetime.strptime('Wed Nov 29 2017', '%a %b %d %Y').strftime('%d %B, %Y')`; that seems to work"
1571,sorry the first linke was suppose to be: <https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/reference/bson-types/#date>
1572,I'm storing the dates in the DB as strings which might be an issue. Might see if I can change it to store as a dateTimeField
1571,"My solution was to split the form date, rearrange it and query the db using __contains. Seems to work ok; ```    if request.method == ""POST"":
        split_date = request.form[""date_choice""].split()

1571,"<@Corrinne> If you're going to split the dates like this using string slices. You really should validate your `formatted_date` Nate posted a much better way of doing it. I'm not sure how your form is validating the string, and since you can't change that (or stop them from changing) probably best you validate it other than the single input pattern you've seen."
1571,hey <@Glinda>. Thanks for the feedback. Will definitely look at implementing a better solution. The date submitted by the form is from a javascript date selector so should be formatted the same every time. But agree with you I should find a better solution.
1573,redine?
1571,redefine
1573,"<@Glinda> my data is like this
```
&lt;name&gt;

1573,None
1573,<@Winnie> I posted a couple of ways you can make it more pythonic
1573,thank you but they don't solve what my program is solving
1574,How so?
1573,After looking at the data it appears that your values for each dictionary can span multiple lines
1573,yeah
1574,Are you also removing new line characters?
1573,only at the end
1573,"can you give an example of your desired processed ?; Something like you're yielding a single dictionary for each `'name': 'value'` pair? `yield {'name': 'value', 'desc': 'multiline combined', 'alt1' : 'multiline combined', 'alt2': 'multiline combined' }`"
1573,yeah
1575,"<@Corrinne> what has worked for me so far is to just store unix timestamps in the database as integers, and then handle all the formatting application-side. this takes care of a single format for datetime, plus no confusion with timezones since everything is utc."

1576,"cron?; or a Windows Scheduler if you're on Win; It's easy to start at $TIME1, but a bit trickier to stop the script at $TIME2"

1577,can be messy :confused:; what if it's doing something; I don't really like self-exiting stuff :slightly_smiling_face:
1577,well I don't know the script but I would imagine a `while time.time() &lt; $TIME2`; so you don't just nuke everything at the end :smile:

1577,Is the program interactive or is it just displaying things?
1577,just displaying
1577,"Then <@Ciera>’s advice is the way to go. You can provide a command-line argument to this script, which would be, for example, a number of seconds to run.
And then you launch it using cron at 9:00 for 7 hours:
`/path/to/script1.py 25200`; I'm not exactly sure about cron and graphical applications, let me check"
1577,if it's a modern linux I would use systemd timers instead of cron :slightly_smiling_face:
1577,"oh, right; haven't had the chance to use this yet; cron is just so comfy :slightly_smiling_face:"
1577,yeah cron is easy; but for more complex things systemd timers are nice.
1577,"oh, you can even stop the service after a number of seconds; no need to code anything in the app itself"
1577,yeah but then you nuke everything I suppose and don't cleanup; or you would need to listen for `SIGHUP` / `SIGKILL`
1577,"afaik, systemd doesn't really `kill -9` right away"
1577,yeah and they also implemented a watchdog to restart your service if not responding

1580,"Hey guys, so im trying to get all the duplicate part_no's that i have stores in a table, and have that in a report that can be downloaded at anytime.

```
def duplicate_components(request):
    response = HttpResponse(content_type='text.csv')
    response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=""duplicate_components.csv""'
    dups = Component.objects.values('part_no').annotate(name_count=Count('id')).order_by().filter(name_count__gt=1)

    writer = csv.writer(response)
    #for components in Component.objects.filter(part_no__in=[item['part_no'] for item in dups]):
    writer.writerow(dups)
    return response
```
Now its working but the output format is not the best, i think its lists in a dict. 
```
{'part_no': u'', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u' ', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'?', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'000000000', 'name_count': 11}	{'part_no': u'0340460000', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'0383560000', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'06127501301', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'06b Renold 38 Chain', 'name_count': 3}
```

Outputs to the file like that, as a csv file so im getting `{'part_no': u'', 'name_count': 2}` in each field. 
How would i change the out put to a normal format eg: 
```
Part_no, Count,
345345345, 4
453453434, 5```"
1580,what I’d do is look at <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>; use that to generate an excel spreadsheet; but your original question… your output is doing exactly what you’re telling it to do; because `dups` is a queryset; how do you iterate over a queryset to extract the values you need to some intermediate object?
1580,"Yeah i know, im struggling with how i can convert it so i can use keys to print them to a csv file"
1580,"well, you’re telling it to use values"
1580,"I have tried to use values_list, i don't know any other alternatives."
1580,"assuming you have a loop like `for dup in dups`; you’d access the property with a dot variable like `dup.part_no`, `dup.name_count`; oh, wait"
1580,I have tried: So i have other reports that i have created
1580,its a dict set; so it’d be `dup.get('part_no')`
1580,ahhhhh
1580,"yeah, because with that one, you’re using the queryset with the actual model objects; with `values`, its just pulling out the field and value alone, and you have to use dict notation"
1580,"writer.writerow([dups.get('part_no'), dups.get('name_count')])"
1580,no; because `dups` is a list of dicts
1580,thats why i need the for loop?
1580,"yes; unless there’s some way `writerow` will take in a dict; hmm, you can use dictwriter instead; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/8331638/214892>"

1580,NVM I GOT IT; <@Suellen> it was a problem of iterating an iterator twice; that's the second time I've had that bug; any tips on how to stop shooting myself in the foot like that?
1580,don't iterate over already exhausted generators ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1580,but I don't know that they're generators...; my functions took in an items field; but I had items as Counter.elements()
1582,thanks any free ebooks out there or anything?; I plan on purchasing this though this seems good but do you know of any free material
1583,"By counter you mean `collections.Counter` ?; Couple of problems I might not be understanding correctly. 
1. You aren't sure if you are getting an iterator or a iterable. In the first case you exhaust your iterable when you compare. The second case you can do a good check later. 

2. You are always getting an iterator and will always run into the exhausted iterator when you want to use the values. 

In the first case you can deal with this by using `isinstance(obj, type)` and the `collections` library. 
```from collections.abc import Iterable, Iterator

def my_iterator(): 
    yield 1

i = my_iterator()
a = []

isinstance(i, Iterator) # True
isinstance(a, Iterator) # False```; So in the case that you actually have an iterable you don't need to worry about exhausting your iterable. This leads us to how do you deal with exhausting an iterable? Well one way is to create an iterable like a list, but this gets rid of the advantages of an iterable- the returned contents could be really large.; Here's a function that goes over another method that keeps it in an iterable, and lets you deal with not having large memory concerns. 
<http://www.effectivepython.com/2015/01/03/be-defensive-when-iterating-over-arguments/>; return True if y else False; ```def test_funct(y_val):
    return True if y_val else False
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(test_funct(None))
    print(test_funct(1))```"
1583,"That's making it longer, I know you can do a one line statement for when you have a boolean operation, I just can't remember the syntax for it"
1583,So you want `single line if else value assignment?`; not single line None checking?; Because if you want to check if a value is none
1583,"I don't necessarily care if it is None, I just have a value that will be either True or None and I want to save it as a False or True. Which I know of the classic `y = True if x else False` but I know I've used something along the lines of `y = if x` in the past for boolean operations like that"
1583,"`small = x if x &lt; y else y`; <https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#id23>; ```def test_funct(y):
    x = True if not y else False
    print(x)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_funct(None)
    test_funct(1)
    ```; I think what you're getting at is; I have two conditions I want to check, `y== True`, `y==False`. Now there's other conditions you could have to consider `y == anything else`; Since you know  the value ""will be either True or None and you want to map `None -&gt; True` or map `True -&gt; False` Then you only have two actual conditions.; in that case you can do this assignment: `x = True if not y else False`"
1583,Yea I mean I understand all that and that's not where my confusion is. I just thought I remember there being some super shorthand way to achieve the same goal but I think I'm mistaking it with something like `x = not y` which is possible
1583,"Looks like you can chain ternary operators, but the only case I've seen requires 3 conditions: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/2919360/8143102>; `1 if a &gt; b else -1 if a &lt; b else 0`; Now since you want things as short as possible practical advice is that in many cases you don't want one line functions that do too many things, there's the programmer you today, tomorrow a month from now and next year. And next year you're going to wonder why you didn't put this single line into a separate function. Name the function something like `def is_value_None(input_value)`"
1584,"`y = bool(x)`, however in almost all cases just using `x` is what you want.  You usually don't want a `bool`, you want something that is ""truthy"" or ""falsey"", and x already is that."
1583,"It looked like he wanted to map `True or None and I want to save it as a False or True` True =&gt; False, None =&gt; True; `y = not bool(x)`; Any suggestions on a way to reverse enumerate that is better than these options- replaced with file; `first` is better due to preserving original index, but not sure I like the `list(....)` part.; I kinda like this `third` wrapper"
1585,`reversed(enumerate(my_list))`?
1583,no need for `list()` conversion in `first()`
1583,"I think, if it works, `enumerate(reversed(my_list))` is better"
1583,or that :stuck_out_tongue:
1583,reversed is a builtin so it should be faster than consume the `enumerate` iterator; but not sure
1583,"`TypeError: 'enumerate' object is not reversible`; yours is best, <@Ciera> :))"
1583,yeah it's something I discovered not to long ago. You can define a `__reverse__` dunder; if not it will consume everything and then reverse it
1583,:open_mouth:; Not sure why I wrote it in such a way; It's more logical to reverse and then enumerate; less work %)
1583,But now the index doesn't correspond to the original index.

```urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    url(r'^(?P&lt;pk&gt;[0-9]+)/$', views.DetailView.as_view(), name='detail'),

    url(r'^api/v1/question/(?P&lt;pk&gt;[0-9]+)/detail/$',views.question_detail,name = 'question_detail.api')
]```


and then I added the last two apis for json response of something similar to what the first two urls would output in html, since I have seen api usually having such names for versions and stuff.. I know i am doing something wrong. So how are they actually separated or are they not? apis and html urls."

1609,I could see that if its not a language used by the company
1610,I'll just add trusted-host
1609,The company isn't exactly a programming company. The PM might pull some strings if I tell him the issue and the networking dept. doesnt come through
1610,cause he hired me specifically to do python lol
1609,Yeah I’d wait for a response before just circumventing it
1610,Yeah definitely. Almost time to go home

1609,eh its easy to say you were blocked by the lack of access so its not like it’ll come down on you <@Myong> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1610,and makes sense given they didnt have anyone really doing python before
1610,Just talked to the PM. He said to forward him the ticket and if it's an issue he'll get it fixed up :thumbsup:; But for now I'm gonna head out I think
1609,Appreciate the help @joe and <@Marcie> :taco:

1619,yes
1617,"You’d have to set up a proper trigger, probably with an API Gateway (<https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/>) but if this is going to be proxying every call, the lambda is going to be called a lot, which is not going to be cheap; Depending on the load, you are probably better off running a small instance on EC2 or whatever you prefer to host the proxy; but if its low enough load, it may be cheaper for the lambda, depending on how long that lambda takes to run"
1617,I don’t expect the calls to be too frequent. But I think you’re right that it would probably be cheaper using an ec2 instance.

with open('/tmp/hoststest', 'r') as hosts_file:
    hosts_data = hosts_file.read()
    print(hosts_data)
    new_hosts_data = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)',r'\1' + new_hosts_data + r'\3',hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)

1623,have you considered dns instead?
1623,":slightly_smiling_face: I knew someone would mention that. Yes I would love to use DNS but in this situation I dont have that control; this will serve my needs but for my education, I’d like to understand the regex better"
1623,"so the pattern is `r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)'`. what does that pattern do, as you understand it, <@Season>?"
1623,"um, I don't think new_hosts_data is defined inside the re.sub function?; this is pretty convoluted, would you be able to transmit a diff and then use `patch` to apply it to your /etc/hosts?"
1623,"its there and sort of working, I jsut must have a problem with my regex because its putting the data inside the file but not replacing the starting and ending tags.  so it replaces

1623,"it seems to me like new_hosts_data already has the tags, so you're inserting them between the literal tags in your regex; that's just a guess"
1623,yes that exactly what happening.  I just cant figure out how to fix it
1623,"```new_hosts_data = '#nhdtag\ninfo\#nhdtag'

yields:
#StartStoreLocations
#nhdtag
info
#nhdtag
#EndStoreLocations```; you'll fix it with; `new_hosts_data = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`; if you want to keep the new_hosts_data tags; if you want to keep the literals but throw away the new_hosts_data tags, then I'd suggest preprocessing new_hosts_data to drop those lines"
1623,does `#StartStoreLocations` or `#EndStoreLocations` ever change?
1623,<@Frieda> no; <@Shavonda> that worked except it wiped out the rest of the file with the new data
1623,? you said the original file only had 3 lines; at least in your example
1623,I simplified it. there are other entries in my hosts file.  I want to update those.
1623,"if they never change, make them non-matching groups and only replace the parts in between; at it is now, it looks like you're always copying them back in"
1623,"thats why I was placing the entries between those tags.  here is my current code with your tweaks

```
with open('/etc/hosts', 'r') as hosts_file:
    hosts_data = hosts_file.read()
    if '#StartStoreLocations' in open('/etc/hosts').read():
        new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)
    else:
        new_hosts_file = hosts_data + new_hosts_data
    
with open('/etc/hosts', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(new_hosts_file)
```; <@Frieda> agreed,  thats what I want to do but I am literally brain dead when it comes to regex.  I cant figure out the syntax, which is why I posted here."
1623,"if new_hosts_data has the tags, just do:
`new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+(.*)#EndStoreLocations', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`; I personally don't really like that `.*?` because it's slippery, so I might change it to `new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'#StartStoreLocations\s*(.*)#EndStoreLocations', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`; but if you like it, it's sorta personal preference"
1623,I like what works at this point :slightly_smiling_face:  trying to wrap my head around it still
1623,"can even drop the perens around `(.*)` since you're not using the backrefs any more, but I think they make it easier to read"
1623,<@Shavonda> works PERFECTLY  thanks!  Now I need to make sure I understand it.  Ive been coding off and on for 20 years and regex has always made my head hurt
1623,"yeah, I wrote a decent bit of perl for like 4 years, but there's a reason people sometimes call regexes a ""write only language""; if you write some guru stuff and don't come back to it for 6 months, you might have no idea what you did"
1623,I don’t use reg much so whenever I looks at it my eyes are like wtf am I looking at.  I’ll go watch a lynda video or something sometime soon
1623,"yah, I sorta recommend against it. I don't know where your input comes from or anything, but as a cron job you might just consider transmitting diffs around and apply them using `patch`; it's a pretty well established and understood format with tools built around it; in your case, your format is pretty straightforward, and hosts files already have a format that generally will avoid any weird regex problems, so it probably doesn't matter"
1623,"Anyone have an example (for the front end mainly) of a way to organize a bunch of different reports?

1626,i spent like 30 min on that one line lol; everything works fine when its hardcoded. :disappointed:
1626,"Alright, I got a question I'm hoping one of you might be able to point me in a better direction.

I'm trying to identify an item based on the name given in an a Description. There are about 25-30 possible items and each possible item has anywhere from 2-20 possible spelling/spacing/wordorder/special characters combinations in the description. For example something like this:

```
ICE_WATER = [""ice/water shield"", ""i/w shield 1 sq"", ""i/w shield 1sq"", ""i/w"",
""i/w shield - surface area"", ""i/w valley"", ""i/w shield"", ]
```

There are overlaps in the description names with other items, so I don't think using any ""distance"" or other search algo will get me accurate results. Hence why I've resorted to exact name matching. (If you disagree maybe I could give you some more examples and I could look into it more.)

originally, I put these all the possible names in one large dictionary with the function to call as the value. I didn't really like how long and ugly the list was and difficult to maintain (as I find new possible items or terms are added) so I'm wondering how ugly/slow using a long list of `if/elif desc in ITEM_LIST` might affect my program (as long as it doesn't add more than a second I think I'll deal with it) or if there is another alternate (possibly even obvious) method I can use to identify these items (each with different calculations that need to be performed). And route them to the appropriate (now) methods."
1626,"You mean, curl request get response; than in other variable do the jq stuff?"
1626,"I'll probably clean it up to where I'm only assigning 2 or 3 attributes per item rather than a separate method for each, but I still need a better way to identify them."
1626,it be nice if .py had switch statement; i think it make this easier; but maybe you can write your own switch
1626,You can make a switch with a dictionary; That's essentially what I had before
1626,"<@Arlene> from testing this might do it
```ID=""$(curl -X GET $PLATFORM_URL/foo \
                     -H ""x-cookie: token=$TOKEN"" \
                    | jq "".[] | .[] | select(.name==\""$NAME\"") | .id"")""```; as this works:
```NAME=foobar
echo ""$(cat ./test.json | jq "".[] | select(.name==\""${NAME}\"")"" )""```"
1626,I guess I could put all of the descriptions in a table with their appropriate attributes and query the table
1626,<@Marcie> :boom: that works; Oh man I am tired today.; lol; <@Marcie> Thanks for taking the time sir!
1626,"<@Staci> you could have descriptions and associated calls in a dict; something like
```checks = {
    'ice_water': [""ice/water shield"", ""i/w shield 1 sq"", ""i/w shield 1sq"", ""i/w"",
""i/w shield - surface area"", ""i/w valley"", ""i/w shield""]
}

def identify_item(self):
    for func_name, attributes in checks.items():
        if self.desc in attributes:
            getattr(self, func_name)()
            break```; though i'd probably move away from the whole bunch of methods on self to more of a composition style in general; yeah thats my normal flow"
1626,"Yea, that is my plan, I just need a way of identifying the items so I can assign the appropriate attributes; I think I may have talked myself into just creating a table, that way it won't require a code change if/when I need to add items in the future; or descriptions rather; but I appreciate your feedback <@Marcie> I like that pretty well"
1627,"Hello, so i want to write a script that reads from an excel sheet made by my collegues, and  based on that, will send some mails (reading both the mailadress to sent to and the mail contents from the spreadsheet).

2. The actual mailsending thourgh smtplib seems pretty straitghforward, but i would like to use the local account to which my collegue is logged in on thunderbird - i fear it might cause troble (security). Also, how difficult would using an ssl certificate be?

1636,Hey guys! Can someone help me. I am new at Python and I am stuck on this script for 2 days. I have script (<https://gist.github.com/2filip3/bd8d0f26491572c1cce355e9f7e0d366>)that monitors folder and notifies me when files are changed. I want to notify me on email but I don't want my email to get spammed because the file changes every 5 sec. So can som1 tell me what change to make in script so I can get notified ONLY when files are NOT CHANGED OR CREATED so I would know my script has stopped. Thank you!; It supposed to be running on server 2.7 Python
1636,"I don't understand; <@Ivonne> 
You
&gt; notifies me when files are changed
but also
&gt;  I can get notified ONLY when files are NOT CHANGED OR CREATED; can you clarify?"
1636,"Yeah sure. Script I am running is monitoring my folder. In that folder i have files tar.gz that are being updated every 5 sec. In my script I get notifications about every change that happens in specified folder. Now, because I wont to get those notifications on email, I need to rewrite script so it doesn't notify on every change because my email would be spammed. I need to modify it in the way that notifies me ONLY when files in specified folder are not being changed/updated or created so I would know when my other script(that is making those files to be updated) has stopped working."
1636,are these like rolling log files?; do you maybe only want a notification when a new file gets created?
1636,Sounds like he just wants to be notified when his script crashes
1636,Could just put an atexit handler on the script
1636,What happens if the host crashes?; Not saying it's relevant in this case
1636,then the script-monitoring script probably went with it; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; need a little more specifics if we're going to go down this particular rabbit hole
1636,I think it might be easier to use a process manager to monitor the first script; than check if files are being created/modified
1636,depends on how the first script typically stops working
1636,"I need to monitor files, not script guys.; Script can be runing but the server that are downloading files from can be busy or at full capacity so my files wouldn't get updated and changeed; I just need to modify script which i've put above in the link so it can notifies me when the files are NOT updated"
1636,"sounds like you should define the files you want to be notified of updates with a unique prefix or suffix; and your script will check all modified files for that; if it matches, send an email"
1636,"I am monitoring whole folder, and i can get notifications on every change. Now I just need tomake little change to notifies me when the files are not changing but I don't know how to do that"
1636,use an interval
1636,are you certain there will not be any files there which are _normally_ not changing?
1636,check every 30 seconds or so for changes
1636,"yah, just stat the files and check for update times more than X seconds old; ```for file in file_list:
  if (os.path.getmtime(file) - time.time()) &gt; 30:
    print 'it has been more than 30 seconds since {} was updated'.format(file)```; something like that"
1636,Well I think this is helpfull but before this I would need to make a function that states whenever the file is created it should be added in the file_list so I can iterate within it. Right?; I was more looking to find some simple solution to modify watchdog; script above
1636,"I don't know how many file notification events you were getting before, or how long you want to wait between checking for activity, but this is probably more efficient than the event based system; the problem with the watchdog is that any event you get will always be the brand new, so you won't really be able to use it to check how 'stale' a file is unless you add some pretty wacky logic; you _could_ use the watchdog to build up your file list and add new files to the list any time you catch a file creation event"
1636,you could also use something else that is built for watching files. you may be able to configure syncthing’s inotify to watch the folder and hit the syncthing rest api. <https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/events.html>

Full code here (<https://github.com/peterglynch/crunch-report-sms/blob/master/CRsms.py>)"
1648,you also loop over `for tweets in screener`. Is this expected ?
1648,I’m not sure if it is intended by I wanted to first get to the user (‘TechCrunch’); So my thinking was `for tweets in TechCrunch` user time line search for tweet with #cruchreport; I’m not really sure how else I would implement
1648,"Sure, since you are using the real browser. And the script isn't a real browser and fails a couple of checks probably."
1648,<@Theressa> I'm not familliar with the tweeter API but what I think this does is loop over the timeline of TechCrunch and for each tweet in the timeline query twitter for a tweet with `#crunchreport`; There might be a way to search a specific user timeline
1648,good point I’ll check the documents; <@Ciera> thanks
1649,"Hey, Can anyone help me out with a Query? 

I have a table called Component supplier and im getting errors telling me that some components have the same supplier twice. 

So i need to make a query that will search either the components table or the Component supplirt table and highlight the records with duplicate suppliers.

At the moment im working from the SupplierComponent table.. and im trying to get the records that have matching part_no's and matching suppliers. 

Any help would be appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:; ```SupplierComponent.objects.values('component_supplier').annotate(name_count=Count('id')).order_by().filter(name_count__gt=1)
```

I have this which lists the supplier and how many components they supply. Now i just need to compare the component, if they have the same part_no and same supplier then i know that record has corrupt data."

1652,"<@Glinda> you can suppress individual types of error by pressing alt+enter in PyCharm and choosing ""Ignore errors like this""; hmmm, I don't know if it differentiates on comments, do you? had never really thought/tried"
1652,That's usually an issue I want to keep.
1652,"agreed, I wonder if there's a way to get more granular, /wonder; as in that's about as far I'm willing to go even though I probably have run across that exact thing; <http://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#configuration>"

The check E133 is mutually exclusive with check E123. Use switch --hang-closing to report E133 instead of E123.

(^) These checks can be disabled at the line level using the # noqa special comment. This possibility should be reserved for special cases.

1652,waat that never came up in my google search
1652,@leo where are datetime saved? Changelog?
1652,no for example
1652,It depends. In my Opinion you can‘t find all via jql
1652,jql=“label=‘string’ AND blah &gt; ‘2017-10-11’; i want to remove “blah &gt; ‘2017-10-11’”; but it is not as simple as using just a regex; i think the link you provided is more to do with working with jira’s api; my problem is more on parsing a language…
1652,"I see. I can‘t really help you.
But just of curiosity - what is the use case?

Who wants to do this change? And through which interface?"
1652,<@Cordie> are these values strings or datetimes?
1652,<@Jeffery> it’s just an app I am building. Jira has a kanban board and i am importing the jql that populates the board; <@Glinda> well i need to cover all hahaha
1653,I don’t really see the value of letting you know there are unused params when it can simplify functions or signal you’re doing something off ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; why would you be writing functions with unused params anyway?
1653,"Yeah, I agree"
1653,Anyone here use jupyter notebooks  &amp; anaconda to manage their environments? I’ve managed to create and manage my packages using the enviornments from anaconda but I can’t seem to get jupyter notebooks to read from the right enviornment too
1653,"joe, it's something with `websocket`; <@Rheba>"
1653,I’ve legit been stuck for 2 days now on this issue :cry:
1653,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37085665/in-which-conda-environment-is-jupyter-executing>; I'm a little out of practice with jupyter/ conda but me switching away from those two was partly due to issues with virtual environments.
1653,<@Glinda> if it’s `on_open` then you just do `ws.on_open = on_open` and drop the `ws` argument since it’s not used. it’s not required for websockets
1653,Dude it fucking blows <@Glinda> but every data scientist I run into uses it :disappointed:
1653,So just drop ws?
1653,yep; same with in `on_close`
1653,"Hmm, must have been a python 2 thing; Bunch of what I was doing was ported from python 2 :confused:; Aite thank you."
1653,"if any argument _must_ be there and isn’t used, naming it `_` is also a preferred method"
1653,"<@Cecille> the problem from transitioning from anaconda to pip is that you're going to run into issues with numpy/ pandas.; conda is great for installing those packages.; And it's really not difficult for someone who has experience with python to do it, but dealing with the binaries _while_ learning python and wanting todo data science is probably the biggest reason I see people pushc onda.; If you have a student id, you can get pycharm pro for free and they are working their darndest to steal that data science money from spyder/ conda.; Give me a second, I want to see if the new changes make it easy to deal with numpy/ pandas in a windows"
1653,"btw <@Glinda> you’re right, the `ws` lib is going to provide that argument by default, so `_` may be better if you aren’t using it"
1653,"Thanks man,  the main reason for asking isn't finding a working solution but best practice."
1654,"yeah it made me realize that it may be forcing that positional arg in, feels like it should be a kwarg but hey i didnt implement it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1653,"It's probably better to treat the socket as a class.; <@Cecille> So I opened a new pycharm project. Typed `ctrl +alt+ s` and created a new virtual environment and applied to this project. Then I  created a folder with these imports. ```import pandas as pd

1654,"Hry guys just found a small bug; In inserting rows of data I have a small thing for inserting `None` in cells which are missing data in order to keep formatting in order for headers and what not; But my issue is that in some cases when there are two or more cells of data missing, the way I am inserting the data into excel is as such; nvm cant put the code; but, my question is, is there a way to order a list based on the order of another list?; so if I have something like `[""hello"", ""bye"", ""ok""] and [""ok"", ""bye""]`; I want the resulting list to be `[""bye"", ""ok""]`; Wait I think I got it actually; Figured it ou!; out"
1654,nice job; Do you use windows 64 python 3?
1655,"Uh oh, another issue :confused:"
1655,?; Maybe take a step back and explain the problem
1655,"So basically I have an excel file I'm generating; Now the response from the GET I make to this API send me XML with a bunch of nodes that have child nodes; I grab the text from the child nodes in the order which it appears; But in some cases the data doesnt contain every node which the header contains; so say the header covers 38 columns cause it can contain 38 different pieces of data; Sometimes I only get 35 from any given node; so I'm missing data; But I wanna insert it under the correct header; so I have a list of headers and the headers are the ""id"" nodes which are always included in the response; I also store each different main node as a dictionary, and place the dictionary in a list"
1655,Can you show an example of the response?
1655,I can not actually
1655,"Even just the header list with id, and another row list of id."
1655,I cant do snippets on this computer; I would just post my code if i could
1655,snippets?; Do you not have `` key?; So since you say order of nodes matter you get the header data first right? So can you get the key from each header item and use it later to match the column from the rows of data?
1655,Yeah basically I have all possible headers and theyre in the proper order; I put the masterlist of headers and also the current headers for the current set in a `set()`; then I take the difference of one set minus the others
1655,Any chance you tried to use a dictionary?
1655,"to get the headers which arent in the data set; I am using a dictionary, yes; When I first filter the data; But I still have to check if the key exists in the data and if it does not I dont add a key to it for that header; debugging right now i have one id i know is messing up; I think I know actually what is happening"
1655,"Without seeing your data and what you want to happen, or code. It's pretty hard for me to help more."
1655,Yeah I know; But I think I know the issue; if there are like 3 keys
1655,Explain why you are using `set()` to filter?
1655,with set you can use `set1 - set2`; so like
1655,set doesn't preserve order
1655,"I reorder it; with filter; `filter()` based on index of headers; but the issue is this; just realize; when inserting into a list with different size than the main header list so like inserting into a size 35 list based on indexes of size 38 list; So if I have `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` as a main list"
1655,"Okay so if you wishto preserve order and subtract items from list_2 from list_1 this is one way you can do it:
```list_1 = []
list_2 = []


list_removed = []
for item in list_1:
    if not item in list_2:
        list_removed.append(item)
        ```; If you wish to add a space to the list when you remove: ```list_1 = []
list_2 = []

list_removed = []
for item in list_1:
    if not item in list_2:
        list_removed.append(item)
    else:
        list_removed.append(None)```"
1655,It seems mostly to be an issue when two missing cells are next to each other towards the end of the list; and there is also a missing cell towards the beginning
1655,"This will also work: `map(lambda x:x if not x in list_2 else None, list_1)`; ```&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [1,7,8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(map(lambda x:x if not x in b else None, a))
[None, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, None, None]```; Actually that works. forgot the not"
1655,"<@Myong> So you're receiving XML, and ultimately you want to build a spreadsheet with it? I'm assuming you're generating a csv file that you're opening in excel, is that right?"
1655,"Yes, I can do pretty much everything but there is an issue with formatting it correctly"
1655,It seems like you're manually generating the csv yourself.
1655,It's pretty complicated to explain you can read back but for now im just debugging it
1655,Have you tried <https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter>
1656,you can even specify a restval to fill in gaps where you don't have a value for the field.
1655,"If you can get the XML into a dict, you can throw each one into a DictWriter object and it will take care of everything for you."
1655,I got it; I think it actually worked the whole time and I looked at the wrong file :upside_down_face:; Okay now I found the issue; It's in deciding what order to insert the items
1657,<@Glinda> got it!
1657,What did you did up doing?
1657,"Found a stackoverflow which pointed to a conda package called ``` nb_conda``` that you need to install; Which is also in the docs butttt they don’t mention that you need to install nb_conda  on the machine and the env; or maybe im just a scrub, who knows. But it works!"

1660,So im not sure if im doing it wrong or just not understanding but how do you make a server using asyncio? I dont get how you write the web handlers
1661,you would need to use the equivalent of something like requests which is aiohttp.
1660,i also think requests now supports asyncio.; let me find a link.
1660,"Like in node and express you use app.get/app.post then the url after the server url, isnt there a sinple way to do this in python?"
1660,I find <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> to be the most express-esque python server
1660,"Well their home page is nice haha, looks very node/express-y"
1660,<@Tangela> when you use the `with cursor` context manager it closes the cursor after the code block; so you need to move all `cursor.execute()` statements to be within that context manager

1663,string too long and invalid chars...
1663,"You kind of have a lot of things happening in this single statement.; What do you want to happen when you encounter 1. string too long, and 2. invalid chars?; Also can you paste the code here, I'd rather not retype most of it the images are helpful."
1663,"1. When encounter a string too long I want inform the user that string is too long for store it on db, 2. The user cannot store on column emails invalid characters like /, *,&amp;, %, etc."
1663,Are you using python &lt; 2.7
1663,I'm using 2.7
1663,"Okay; So I split your system into three parts.; So now you have a single location where you might have an exception `db_cursor.execute('INSERT INTO {table_name}s({table_name}) VALUES {row}'.format(table_name=table_name, row=row))`"
1663,Thank you very much <@Glinda> I was using try..except in everywhere but with your code was reduced to 3 at least
1663,"You know, I don't think you need the `cursor.close()`; Couple of things: 1. Don't use user=root, pw = '' set your password to something if you must use root.; 2. Try to define functions and make them reusable; Make your functions do as limited as possible; The more they do, the harder it is to debug.; A bunch more things I can suggest. But primarily, try and use python 3, and try and use a ORM like sqlalchemy.; If you're just getting into python, it's better to start off with python 3.; Anyways, feel free to ask any more questions, or more help. I'll be around here for a little while longer tonight."
1663,"I see, from now on I will write more generic functions, I usually don't do that, later I got lost in the errors, py2.7 should be discontinued so maybe better try the most actual, there huge differences between it?"
1663,Probably the biggest thing you'll notice is in python3 print is a function `print('string')`

1667,<@Alexa> why are you converting to json when you alreayd have xml to dict conversion?
1667,"<@Alexa> could you post the code here as pyhon snippet? And yeah, loads after dumps is nosense."
1667,<@Meg>  i am not able extract data from dict.. also  
1667,"if I read your code right, you’re converting xml to a dict, then to json string, then load that string it as a dict; what do you get when you do `type(xmltodict.parse(stream))`?"
1667,<@Meg> let me check
1667,that should be a dict; <https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict>
1667,<@Meg>  i am getting OrderedDict ([(....
1667,"ok, that’s a dict there; so how are you accessing the keys?"
1667,<@Wade>  any way to achieve this 
1667,<@Alexa> btw beware: json.dump and json.dumps are quite different methods
1667,"one relies on a file, and the other relies on a string; <@Alexa> use this for code formatting; <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>; because what’s appearing here is you’re doing the wrong thing with loading the data into a dict, and reading from the dict"
1667,'for i in A.items():'
1667,and then?
1667,"""""""for i in A:
	for k,v in i.item():
		print(k,v)"""""""
1667,"those are backticks, not quotes; on the left side of the 1 key; usually; :smile:; ok, there are a number of problems here; first, you have to use `items()` for `A`, and not inside it"
1667,it was type mistake items only there..
1667,"eg 

```for i in A.keys():
    for k, v in i.items():
        print(k, v)
```; because you need to specify _what_ you’re trying to get from the dict"
1667,ok; lmc
1667,because its not an iterable by default
1667,"this will fail if one of your ""outer"" dict values are not dict themselves; uh wait"
1667,<@Wade> <@Meg> not i am getting above error
1667,that doesn’t make any sense at all; are you using `A = xmltodict(stream)`?
1667,"in your snippet ""i"" is one of the keys of a dict; and it's not possible it's a dict, because dicts are not hashable by default (probably OrderDicts are, but idk); (and dict keys needs to be hashable...ofc)"
1667,"<@Wade> yes, I was wondering if it is a good solution in terms of performance and design. What I would like to have is an agnostic adapter for the APIs side of the application. Moreover, I’vent found that much about nameko and AMQP. Do you have any good example how to use it with Redis or Rabbit? Thanks a lot ; <@Tangela> could you show what kind of data your CSV have? "
1667,<@Wade>  got it but it is not the key.. in dict let me ping the full code then u guys will get the clear idea ..
1667,"<@Tangela> other than the error you are getting (probably because that 'row' is invalid) , there is another kind of error (a LOT worst). You are exposing your system to be SQLInjected. If someone puts in that CSV a malicious snippet of SQL code, you run it in your database :slightly_smiling_face: look at psycopg2 docs and about SQLInjection generally <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html>"
1667,Thanks <@Wade>! going to check it
1667,"<@Jacki> no, i'm sorry. I've not used celery or nameko. I only heard of them and look'd at their API some time ago"
1667,"I use celery alot, but not with nameko; celery tasks are integrated with django apps, so I call them through regular django HTTP API calls"
1669,"Hey slackers,  I started work for a new company 6 weeks ago, that is in desperate need of automation across the board..  I have been implementing python and bash scripts here and there to prove concepts and add some immediate value.  I want to step this up a notch and implement some type of integration platform that I can use to consume and push to rest APIs.   This is what I have been doing with python, bash and cron, but I’d like some sort of platform versus a bunch of scripts and cron.  I was looking at <https://zato.io/> and wondered what you all thought about it and if there are others I should check out as well."
1670,"That won’t prevent SQL injection, you’re putting the values directly into the query without sanitizing them; <http://bobby-tables.com/python>; though it depends on which database module you are using; Also, a small thing, but it’s a lot easier to share code/output on here with snippets or code formatting with backticks instead of screenshots"
1670,"idk MySQLdb syntax, so you should check the API yourself. Consider using psycopg2, which support almost all SQL drivers <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html>; in the usage there is also the example to avoid SQLInjection"
1670,`psycopg2` supports other dialects?
1670,you sure psycopg2 supports mysql?? I can't find anything about it mentioned in their documentation or anywhere else...
1670,I’m 99% sure `psycopg2` is specifically postgres
1670,"for mysql he should be using MysqlDb, which also supports DB API2; me too, I got really surprised when I read such an statement"
1671,"So, maybe should be better using a ORM like SQLAlchemy?"
1671,"Realistically you should be using some type of framework that makes it so you don't have to write out the sql statements. I like sqlalchemy, but my experience level is like maybe a total of 50 hours. Some people here can provide you good alternatives."
1670,"<@Patty> <@Keneth> aww gawd, i'm so dumb. Yeah it's postgresql specific :sweat:"
1671,#sorry
1671,"I used SQLAlchemy some years ago, was my first touch with a ORM, I guess will not be problematic try to implment,  anyway better that use pure sql statements. Thanks <@Wade>  <@Patty> <@Keneth> <@Glinda>"
1671,"<@Tangela> if you are adventurous enough, give a try to peewee. A simpler and smaller ORM, but yet powerful enough. I've been using it with Flask and I love it.; it has extensions for some of the most used databases, and it's quite awesome. The author, owner and maintainer helps with doubts on Stackoverflow quite quickly.; anyway, there's no problem using SQL sentences, if you need them. But the DBApi2 interface supports parameters, which sanitizes the input for you for the values, so things like SQLInjection are less prone."
1672,"Hi ... I am new to django and I keep running to migration problems like `django.db.utils.DatabaseError: ORA-00904: ""CORE_COMMAND"".""HIGH_RISK_JUSTIFICATION"": invalid identifier`.  Is there a trick in trouble shooting these sort of issues?"
1671,<@Keneth> +1 for peewee. I tried it and was so smooth and easy
1672,is this oracle?
1672,yes
1672,"what happens when you google examples of that error; not sure how oracle handles it, but invalid identifier seems to me its a bad type or null value when there’s something expected"
1672,oh its pretty clear that the column high_risk_justifitication does not exist in the core_command table.  But the the django core/model.py references that field.
1672,"did you make a migration?; a new one, that is"
1672,and I have done the makemigrations and migrate
1672,is the first in the migrations?
1672,about the only thing I can think of is there’s some sort of migration out of order.
1672,or one didn’t generate correctly and the SQL may show the field wasnt being created
1672,"is this a new column name, or is it being re-used from a previously deleted/renamed column?"
1672,There is a migration file that adds so I'd say it s new column
1672,do you set a default value for the field?
1672,would zapping the pyc files help at all or be a disaster; I'll check for a default value; nope no default value
1672,"ok, if the field is not nullable, that’s a bad thing; because if you’re changing a db table by adding in a not null field,you need to specify _some_ value to be inserted"
1672,"`    high_risk_justification = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)`; so I need to add a default?; looks like it is nullable ..."
1672,"what I’d do is remove `null = True`; <https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tips/2016/07/25/django-tip-8-blank-or-null.html>; &gt;Now, where most developers get it wrong: Defining null=True for string-based fields such as CharField and TextField. Avoid doing that. Otherwise, you will end up having two possible values for “no data”, that is: None and an empty string. Having two possible values for “no data” is redundant. The Django convention is to use the empty string, not NULL."
1672,would that fix my oracle ORA-00904 issue or is that just a best practice suggestion
1672,best practice; because I really don’t have a clue why that migration error is happening; if you run `manage.py migrate --list` do you have any unapplied migrations other than that one
1672,cool thanks I'll try that
1673,turned out that my django db user does not have privs to drop the tables before running my tests; so I had to log in via sqlplus as more priv'ed user and drop the tables
1673,interesting.  too bad the migration errror didn’t give more detail about that…; nice find though
1674,"after an `os.fork()`, from a a child process, how do I pick up from the parent process when the child calls `os._exit(n)`? I don't want my parent to wait on the child because I need to fork a few times, I just want to be able to poll for when all child processes have completed and then continue execution from there"
1674,is there any way you can refactor from fork to use suprocess instead?
1674,"That's the eventual goal but I'm trying to understand the root basics of forks and inter process communication before I use subprocess to hide the details; That and I tried it with subprocess first when I initially wrote the code but failed and ended up running everything in serial instead because it was simpler and faster to develop, but now I have time to go back and learn more about it so I'm starting at the very bottom; It's easier to learn when I can see the actual forks and exits and everything happening within the code itself"
1675,"Hey, is anyone keen to briefly discuss a database design 2-3 tables with me ?"

1676,"It doesn't quite work like that in Python. You write a script, execute the code and you can display output using the print function, either in your terminal or an IDE. It doesn't just output on the fly. Try a simple editor/ide like IDLE, which comes bundled with Python"

1676,"Some understanding of logic, specifically symbolic logic, is good for any programming language.; But I'd probably not recommend a new student rush out and sign up for a course in it."

1678,:confused:
1678,"When I used other approach previously, worked perfectly..."
1678,"<@Tangela>: You should never do it that way; it's actually usually simpler to do it without a `.format()`.; And it's not just about SQL injection attacks; you have to quote the values correctly just for the query to work correctly at all, in the first place, so you don't have problems like the above."
1678,"<@Louis> I know that's dangerous, I am just using this way because is I'm trying to find the error point so I did simple just to debug easier. Do you mean quote the {row} value? Well,  I tried put into double quotes, what print something like VALUES(""[\'<http://00author.com|00author.com>\']"")\' However I get the same error about syntax"
1678,"<@Tangela>: Well, it's not just dangerous; it often just won't work at all. :); Python string escaping just is not the same as DB escaping.; If it worked before, it only worked by accident.; What's the actual data you have, and the query you want?"
1678,"I have a list of domain and url's, I want insert into database, There are so many entries, so I using a loop."
1678,"You can do it in a single `executemany()`, without a loop.; What are the rows?"
1678,row in this case are  each line of file
1678,"I know, but what's the structure? What are the columns?"
1678,#ID #DOMAIN
1678,"Note that adding the table name into the query is a special case: That's part of the query construction itself, rather than data parameters going into the query.; (That's why it's separate.)"
1678,"<@Louis> Tried your code, I got this error: *TypeError: not enough arguments for format string* maybe is because of *%*"
1678,Where do you get that error?
1678,"on this line: db_cursor.executemany(query, rows); I'm using Python 2.7 I don't know if changed something about on 3.5 version"
1678,That probably means the CSV rows aren't actually two columns?
1678,"Not in really, I made some adjustments so now seem work fine, but now I got problem with another syntax problem while executing *executemany*; *_mysql_exceptions.ProgrammingError: (1064, ""You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'domain VALUES ('<http://00author.com|00author.com>'),('<http://00go.com|00go.com>'),('<http://00it.com|00it.com>'),('<http://03e.info|03e.info>'),('0n-line.' at line 1"")*; the new query is as follow: *query = 'INSERT INTO {}s {} VALUES (%s)'.format(table_name, table_name)*; Translating: INSERT INTO *DOMAINS*(DOMAIN VALUES( )"
1678,"<@Tangela>: Okay, so according to that, your CSV is a single column, not two, so the query should be `(%s)` instead of `(%s, %s)`.; Your query has to fit the structure of the data you're inserting. :); Why do you have `{}s {}`? That doesn't make sense.; You should only have the table name there.; What are you passing in as the `table_name`?"
1678,When try with *execute* got this:  _mysql_exceptions.ProgrammingError: not all arguments converted during string formatting

In console i see this.

There is a repetition of the same.  To remove just StreamHandler? Right?"
1678,"<@Louis> My table name is Domains, my Column is Domain"
1678,"<@Tangela>: It needs to be `executemany` when you're inserting multiple rows, not `execute`.; <@Tangela>: Do the table and column names actually have to be dynamic here?"
1678,"Yep, I saw now that I am not inside a for loop:sweat_smile:; Should be good dynamic because after probably I'll add about 160 columns :sweat_smile:; Maybe is dealing the ""."" as a separator?"
1678,<@Tangela>: Does this actually need to be CSV at all?; It shouldn't; your previous examples showed it being parsed as expected.
1678,"Not in really; could be txt; But even using text file instead csv show the same error; Forget it, I did remove :grimacing: but the error persist"
1678,There's probably too many small errors and unknowns and not enough info for me to help debug further. :/
1678,<@Tangela> it's coming along nicely. Starting too look more polished.
1678,Much more! I could use ORM but first I want make this way work:grin:

1678,Why are you trying to make a method private?
1678,"The method is only helpful for that class and not any other classes, so I think it should be private."
1678,"It's my understanding that the ""were all consenting adults"" philosphy means if it' works without making it private don't make it private"
1678,But can you do the patching while keeping it private?
1678,"not sure about the patching, but if you do prefer to mark something as an implementation detail and not relevant to anybody else, prefixing with a _ is the pythonic way of doing that"
1678,"it could be that by marking it private, it's preventing the patching from not working, because you're trying to access a private method.; I'm not really sure"
1678,double underscore prefixes should generally be avoided
1678,agreed

1684,"if I use `<http://logger.info|logger.info>('some thing')` it works, should I be using `logger.new_member('some thing')` to access this new handler?"
1684,"You need to have two logger instances: `logger = getLogger(__name__)` for general-purpose log messages and `new_event_logger = getLogger(f'{__name__}.new_member')` for ""new_member"" log messages; And you configure ""info_file_handler"" to work only with your ""my_module"" logger, but ""new_member_event"" handler - with ""my_module.new_member"" logger; Then `<http://logger.info|logger.info>(""..."")` goes to, say, ""info_file_handler"" handler and `<http://new_event_logger.info|new_event_logger.info>(""..."")` goes to ""new_member_event"" handler"

1687,"let say I have a serviceA which has tasks to be consumerd; consumed; and let say that serviceB is my Celery application in charge of dealing with tasks; how I can request to serviceB to run tasks?; so, in other words,; how do you expose the APIs of the serviceB; ?; <@Patty>, yes i am looking to send tasks"
1687,"makes sense.

what I do is each django app’s celery tasks are integrated with the exposed api for that app; where some POST requests explicitly trigger one or many tasks"

  -- requirements.txt; so, I am able to run tasks, such as sending emails; but, my question is, do I need to integrate Celery with django or I can use it; in a stand alone application adding a layer of communication; like, RPC or REST or whatever; and use it just as a distributed task Q"
1687,"hmm, ok.  So to be clear, celery consists of three parts:
worker, broker and task; you’ve already written up the tasks; and you apparently already use rabbit to handle the task queueing"
1687,Can anyone recommend a library for grabbing an address from coordinates?
1687,"the worer is completely de-coupled from everything, and just listens to messages from the broker; geocoding?; so you have that cluster and communication, <@Jacki>; thing is, tasks are highly specific, are they not?; you can use OOP and task classes to create levels of inheritance, but in the end, a task is highly specific to the thing it is supposed to do"
1688,<@Myong> <http://geocoder.readthedocs.io/api.html#reverse-geocoding>
1687,"true; but still, if i have to send 100 email to 100 users; I have to communicate the array of those 100 email addresses"
1687,no
1687,"oh,"
1687,"well, yeah.  but not exactly; you have the data from your backend service; you post it to your rabbit broker; and the workers pick it up"
1687,<@Jacki> do you _want_ to handle sending emails to users? that can be a mess and end up with your email server running into all kinds of problems when it starts getting blacklisted. if youre looking to move this up to production-level i’d integrate with an external mailing service
1687,"and I suppose it’s the same with Redis; <@Patty>, yes I already have an external mailing service where all the stuff; and basically yes I have to send email mgs as result of some actions"
1687,"so, long story short, you can indeed make a service layer of sorts to handle the task calling and execution; question is, does having this explicit layer make sense in your overall application and project structure?"
1687,"well, yes because I can only send a payload to a serviceA; and I don’t have to take care of broker; or other technology stack"
1687,uhm you _do_
1687,serviceA will be in charge of
1687,because you need that for celery
1687,do whatever he wants to do
1687,or for any kind of asynchronous task queue
1687,"oh yes, serviceA has celery and use Redis in my example; and he has a public endpoint; just to receive the work to perform; is that make sense?"
1687,"What I get from you is Service A is a backend service, and you need it to pass off async tasks to celery workers."
1687,"@http(‘POST’, ‘/api/email_dispatcher’)
          task = tasks.send_email.delay(payload_to_send,url_to_call)"
1687,<@Ciera> question about slack api. I have two application credentials 1. real slack  2. test slack. I got my application to work using the test slack and now i want to go back and get the `xoxb-` token for real slack. Problem is when I try and use the real slack token it's apparently connected only to the test slack.
1687,something like that
1687,"why not import the task module in Service A and execute it there via 

```task = SomeTask()
task.apply_async(args = [arg1, arg2], queue = 'specific_queue')
```"
1687,Is there a universal way to query an API to ask for entries where keys dont exist?
1687,"yes is what I did; but,; in my local env; I have one console with the celery worker runs; and another one where I run the serviceA; in order to expose the APIs"
1687,"<@Myong> no, this is something that would only be available if the API implemented it"
1687,figured as much
1687,but I don’t know how to put those guys into docker containers and then into production
1687,"I don’t think you should dockerize celery in prod; since the workers are running as daemons, anway; at least, they should; so, docker really doesn’t apply here, IMO"
1687,<@Glinda> are you sure you haven't mixed up your tokens ? :smile: A token is link to a slack team
1687,Pretty certain
1687,uhmm; but from an architectural point of view
1687,"I tried it a few times last night, and even reinstalled application"
1687,<@Jacki> <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/daemonizing.html>
1687,I'm trying to use the RTM api and I'm wondering if it's a cache issue.
1687,does it make sense to have a serviceA with a public APIs and Celery?
1687,"uhm, yes"
1687,"oh ok, but I think you can put it into a container; but"
1687,"oh, for development certainly"
1687,if I can have a serviceA with public API and Celery inside
1687,but production?
1687,I should have to run the serviceA with python service.py and at the same time; the celery worker; am I right?
1687,correct
1687,"so, in the end, Can Celery be used as a standalone distributed task management?; @dd2 thanks a lot for helping me.; @dd2 <https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/dockerize-a-flask-celery-and-redis-application-with-docker-compose>"
1687,"yeah, I’ve seen that before, and have talked with Ken Cochrane at Docker about this very thing; FWIW, I like that setup for development; production, no"
1687,what do you suggest for production?
1687,"so, I I have a 10 servers on AWS; and 12 different queues; workers on celery servers are daemonized, where workers are listening to one or more queues, depending on the task resource requirements, run time, etc; for example, tasks that run in five seconds require fewer resources than tasks with 6 hours run time; then my app API pushes new tasks into the rabbit broker queues"
1687,and what about scalability
1687,"no problem.  Spin up 1 or 10 new servers, map them to the queues required and its hands off after that; then when it comes time to spin down, shut down the worker processes and wait for them to finish executing the currently executing tasks"
1687,"ok, makes sense."
1687,"once that’s done, the workers will stop listening to the queue, and the broker doesn’t care"
1687,problably I am using a cannon to shot a fly
1687,"if all you’re doing is sending out emails with this, then yeah; much better ways to handle that"
1687,like coding a queue; and send email using aiohttp
1687,"no, use an external mailing service; because you’re running the risk of being blacklisted"
1687,i can’t really use an external service for policy; so no mailchimp or stuff like that; and I can assume that I won’t be backlisted
1687,something like this might make more sense for you; <https://github.com/nvie/rq>
1687,I’ll have a look at; thanks
1687,good luck :smile:
1687,"so, in a nutshell, when Celery is a good solution?; a large collections of vms taks deployments?; loading the top 100 stories from a remote services?"
1687,"when you have repeatable tasks that you want to keep out of the http request-response loop; with quality scale up/down capability; for example, I just finished indexing 10 million mirrored web pages in solr for search using celery.  took 3 days to do; brought online some extra servers from AWS to handle the extra load, and shut them down when it was done"
1687,"great.; cool, I know how I’ll spend the rest of the day; thanks again; I’ll try to sort it out"
1689,<@Glinda> there is no cache that I know of for the rtm
1687,"but may I ask you why you don’t like the docker solution; for a production env; i mean, docker is strong enough and reliable; is it something related to celery itself ?"
1687,"just don’t see the need for it; because celery workers are already daemonized; so, why go through the docker layer?"
1687,"to have a configuration ready to start in different env; you do the conf once, you can repeat everywhere, even localy"
1687,"```pip install -r requirements.txt
cp celery-default /etc/default/celeryd
sudo service celeryd restart
```"
1687,I’ll try your way
1687,that’s pretty much it for me.
1687,ok
1687,"that said, I am going to be teaching myself docker this winter.  It has benefits I can use; but I just don’t see any distinct advantage to containerizing celery on dedicated servers that are wholly responsible for async workers"
1687,portability is one of the main advantages; your container is not  coupled to your server
1687,Where should I ask questions about test cases for a project?
1687,"but, yes, I see your point; anyway I am trying to put my celery app into a container; and see what’s going on"
1687,"you might want to check out <https://github.com/pyslackers/website>; when you signed up for the group, that’s the website that’s behind it"
1687,ah ok; thanks
1690,Hey <@Patty> I was using google for queries with `geocoder` but I'm finding I'll quickly be over the limit as far as requests go. Which other provider is good to use?
1691,"<@Ciera> figured it out, pycharm ""refactored"" when I moved old creds to `archive` folder and my creds was pointing to the wrong variable.; :facepalm:"
1690,<@Myong> <http://geocoder.readthedocs.io/#providers>
1691,"right now I have `creds.py`in a file, with that file added to `.gitignore` Currently testing locally, what are some better ways than that?"
1691,environment variables; and second choice would be args to pass at startup for testing
1691,"Trying ArcGIS atm, giving error for SSL cause of works WiFi..."
1691,"I tend to favor Environment variables as well, primarily because in the case of a deployed environment it allows you to change them without a re-deploy. I usually have a settings file that can be loaded that refrences the envvars to keep it tidy and not leak envvars all over the code base"
1691,yeah environment variable is usually the way to go and it's really easy to load them in a script
1690,"how do I convert `""2017-12-08 17:19:36 -0600""` to `""2017-12-08 23:19:36` in python"

1691,I'm not sure if you have control of the API but it might be easier to change it to a timestamp
1691,"no control of the api; timestamp wont work for me,; ill try to see if i can get it to be `2017-12-08 23:19:36` in this format"

1691,WOW that is AWESOME; Thanks <@Suellen>
1691,:tada:
1691,Turns out bings API isn't ratelimited and allows upwards of 250k queries a year so that should do.; so I guess it is rate limited at 250k queries a year but whatever
1692,does anyone has ever used Celery with Redis sentinels?; it is driving me crazy …
1692,"Question: I have a server-side application that automates downloading a bunch of excel files, performs some ETL, and writes them to a SQL db. I have like 30 functions that contain each search (automated through selenium, and the site's HTML doesn't really lend itself to iterating through those searches in a single function). I currently have one master function that calls all 31 functions, but is there a more pythonic way to run all of these searches without calling every function in another function? It just looks amtuerish to me."
1692,Are the functions just different in terms of the search arguments they're called with or are they actually different functions?
1692,"Also, is this a blocking function or are you using some sort of task queue like Celery?"
1692,<@Antionette> They are different functions.; <@Nicole> I'm not using a task queue.
1692,Is there an easy way to wrap a `slackclient` rtm_socket in a flask app so I can host on `pythonanywhere`
1693,Not that I know of but the you could host it on digital ocean 
1693,I didnt know time objects would be such a big pain today haha. If I have the time in a string like `2017-12-11 11:21:29` is there a good way to convert string times like that into UTC times in python?
1693,There is the arrow lib <@Suellen> showed you or `datetime.strptime`
1693,do you know the timezone?
1693,"I do, but it be nioce not to have to know it"
1693,you can't convert time to UTC without knowing its original timezone
1693,whatever whatever -0600 is; central USA i think; yea lets say its central
1692,"<@Enid> Running a lot of discrete tasks server-side sounds, at least on the surface, like a possible application for Celery ... especially if the tasks don't have a lot of dependencies.  It doesn't really sound like a question of ""pythonic"" or not."
1693,And Celery is but one (popular) approach.
1693,"I think i got it with this; ```
In [48]: x
Out[48]: '2017-12-11 11:21:29'

In [49]: date_str = x

1693,this didn't change the time. You just added the timezone info to be UTC
1694,is that what you want ?

1696,[Is there any way for me to replicate a POST/GET request sent to a java server to generate a query that way I can simply use the `requests` module to do so? Or is this something I have to do with `BS4` or a similar library by entering the data to fill in each form field; I have the source of the form data from the POST in the format `owner_name=&amp;asr_r_zipcode=&amp;radiusChoice=all&amp;fiLatDeg=` and so on. Would I have to pass these form fields to `requests` in the form of a dictionary/json?
1696,I believe requests would just accept them in the url but not 100% sure on that; You could use this to parse to a dictionary (<https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/urllib.parse.html?highlight=url%20parse#urllib.parse.parse_qs>)
1696,"Hmmm, can't seem to get it to work for a multi select list of items; <@Antionette> thanks for the link, just trying to get this multi select list to work. Doesnt fill anything in for it"
1696,Can you post the actually string you have for it here?
1696,Yeah one sec; <http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/AsrSearch/asrAdvancedSearch.jsp?fromRefine=Y&amp;radiusChoice=all&amp;fiLatDir=N&amp;fiLongDir=W&amp;fiRadiusMetricType=Kilometers&amp;fiHeightChoice=all&amp;fiOverallAGLExactMetricType=Meters&amp;fiOverallAGLRangeMetricType=Meters&amp;ars_r_struct_code=PIPE&amp;fiDateType=asr_r_date_last_action&amp;fiSelDateSearchType=fiToFromDateRange&amp;fromDate=01%2F01%2F2017&amp;toDate=12%2F11%2F2017&amp;fiFromMonth=01&amp;fiFromDay=01&amp;fiFromYear=2017&amp;fiToMonth=12&amp;fiToDay=11&amp;fiToYear=2017&amp;fiExactMatchInd=N&amp;fiRowsPerPage=100&amp;fiSortBy=registration_num&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;jsValidated=true>; The problem is in the key `asr_r_struct_code`; Doesn't select any of the 15 options it shows; It's one of those multi selects where you have to use either Shift or Ctrl to select multiple items; Not sure if that's because they have to be actually clicked or what.
1696,It might need to be `asr_r_struct_code[]`; hmmm although the name is just asr_r_struct_code
1696,Yeah
1696,"When you say it doesn't select any of the 15 options shown, what do you mean? because none of the params come up filled in for the get request to that page.  Do you mean when you post its not returning the correct/expected results?"
1696,"Yeah, in the post request the page that loads up, the parameters which I enter do not get sent"
1696,oh in your original link you have `ars_r_struct_code` but the field name is `asr_r_struct_code`
1696,On the backend it must just not take in the parameters for the select; okay let me check; Still doesn't take in the parameter; odd...
1696,Can you post the dictionary that you're passing to requests?
1696,"Yeah; `{'radiusChoice': ['all'], 'fiLatDir': ['N'], 'fiLongDir': ['W'], 'fiRadiusMetricType': ['Kilometers'], 'fiHeightChoice': ['all'], 'fiOverallAGLExactMetricType': ['Meters'], 'fiOverallAGLRangeMetricType': ['Meters'], 'asr_r_struct_code': ['BANT', 'BPOLE', 'BTWR', 'GTOWER', 'MAST', 'MTOWER', 'NNGTANN', 'NNLTANN', 'NNMTANN', 'NNTANN', 'POLE', 'TOWER', 'TREE', 'UPOLE', 'UTOWER'], 'asr_r_status_code': ['G'], 'fiDateType': ['asr_r_date_last_action'], 'fiSelDateSearchType': ['fiToFromDateRange'], 'fromDate': ['01/01/2017'], 'toDate': ['12/11/2017'], 'fiFromMonth': ['01'], 'fiFromDay': ['01'], 'fiFromYear': ['2017'], 'fiToMonth': ['12'], 'fiToDay': ['11'], 'fiToYear': ['2017'], 'fiExactMatchInd': ['N'], 'fiRowsPerPage': ['100'], 'fiSortBy': ['registration_num'], 'Submit': ['Submit'], 'jsValidated': ['true']}`; Sorry, I can't do snippets; This is direct output from `parse_qs`; from the raw string input after pre-selecting what I wanted and viewing the form data in the post"

1696,"Yeah, it's odd; Let me try; and do multiple selects on the other menu; one sec; Yeah, I guess it just needs to physically be entered. It doesn't pick up anything in those menus at all it would seem.; The request just brings you back to the page to select everything, so I'm not sure what I'm missing; let me try to post again with python instead of just entering the url..."
1696,what url are you posting to? `<http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/AsrSearch/asrResults.jsp?searchType=TRA>`?
1696,yeah; I guess it might actually be grabbing the content; Gotta find the function to pretty print it; Yeah not sure at this point actually.
1696,You could try writing the response to a file and then opening that local file in a browser to see if it matches what you'd be expecting; alternatively the title of the results page is `ASR Registration Search Results` whereas the title of the search page is `ASR Advanced Registration Search` so you might be able to do a quick check of that to see if the page is at least right even if its a bit harder to check if the results match what you'd expect
1696,"Yeah it's the search itself, not the results"
1696,ah kk
1696,I'm heading out now so I'll take a look into it tomorrow.; Thanks for your help <@Antionette> :taco:
1696,"kk, feel free to send me the actual code your using and I can take a look at in a bit"
1697,"hello,
So lets say we have to process a list and compare every list indice to the next indice like this:
if foo(list[n]) == bar(list[n+1): 
The way I implemented that in my script (ignoring what the foo and bar actually do) is something like this:; And i feel like it's really unpythonic and bad : &lt;"
1697,maybe try using enumerate and compare backwards instead of forwards
1697,"So you want to compare each value in list to the next one, but you're actually doing `foo(value_1)` to `bar(next_value)`"
1697,"no, a value needs to be compared only to the next value"
1697,So what is `foo` and `bar` in your syntax?
1697,"doesn't matter i think really, i'm just asking if writing code this way is good, actually we could get rid of foo and bar and just compare the values. The code actually works, but i think it could be made more readable"
1697,"```def compare(input):
    for first, second in zip(input, input[1:]):
        if first == second:
            print('hooray!')
        
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    input2 = [1,2,3,4,4,6]
    compare(input)
    compare(input2)```; That shouldwork nicely."
1697,awww this is so nice !; thanks : D
1697,replacing `==` with `is` also works for integers and strings
1697,"gotta remember that; on a side note; is it normal for a begginer that slowly starts to write code that actually does sometging meaningful, to look at my code and think ""this is such a mess"", even if it works? Also, do you know a good place where i can show more experienced people my code for review? I know there is a code review subreddit but didn't see much traffic there."
1697,"1. I can't answer this one, I learned python after c/c++ so even the simple things looked less messier. 2. You can probably show anywhere you want, but there's _sooo_ many things to improve on don't feel bad if you're writing ""bad"" code. Just keep improving."
1697,"trying to, thanks for the help : )"
1697,To clarify 1. Python looked much cleaner than c++
1698,"Team,i need some help in running a python script which is on windows via ubuntu machine; i have created a paramiko session to that machine; and when i pass this command to exec command func of paramiko  command = 'cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe C:\pythonattempt\try.py""; its not working; can some one guide me here; i have ssh server running on that machine"
1698,can you import another python script only if time is in range ?
1699,"Hi all.
I have little problem with performance may little function:
```
import itertools


def removNb(n):
    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))
    pairs = list(itertools.combinations(numbers, 2))
    total = sum(numbers)
    pairs = list(filter(lambda par: par[0] * par[1] == total - (par[0] + par[1]), pairs))
    result = pairs + list(map(lambda par: (par[1], par[0]), pairs))
    result.sort()
    return result
```
Any idea haw make this better. I'm only beginner in Python :slightly_smiling_face:"
1699,Could you explain what is the end goal of the function ? :slightly_smiling_face:
1699,"a sorry; He says that the product of a and b should be equal to the sum of all numbers in the sequence, excluding a and b.
Given a number n, could you tell me the numbers he excluded from the sequence?
The function takes the parameter: n (n always n &gt; 0) and returns an list of the form: `[(a, b), ...]`
It happens that there are several possible (a, b). The function returns an empty array if no possible numbers are found.
#Example:
```
removNb(26) should return [(15, 21), (21, 15)]
```; As I said, I'm a beginner :slightly_smiling_face:"
1699,"I would start with something like ```
for x in range(n/2):
  for y in range(n/2, n):
    if ....
```"
1699,but `n/2` not always is int
1699,oh yeah my bad. you should cast it to an int. `int(n/2)`
1699,"but still it does not give the intended effect because now `a` is max 12 and as you can see an example, `a` is equal to 15 and in the next tuple 21; a is x; and should check all possible pairs of numbers"
1699,ah yeah my bad. I wasn't sure a `/2` would work.; anyways you can do two loops in `range(n + 1)`. (forgot the +1 also :p); that's quite fast; it's the `map/filter` that are longer I suppose; I'm going to go eat something. I can make a better snippet afterwards if needed :slightly_smiling_face:
1699,"unfortunately, I have tried this too and it is even slower; ```def removNb(n):
    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))
    total = sum(numbers)
    result = []
    for first in numbers:
        for second in numbers:

and I would be very grateful for your help.; I'm back to work now if you find something please send to me directly, thx :slightly_smiling_face:"
1699,I'm not sure what are the limits of `n` are but I think once you reach higher number you need to be clever about it and skip ranges of number.
1699,"Problem has piqued my curiosity! Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, <@Ciera>. Have to think about the mathematics of the problem and find a shortcut so you don't need to compute so much"
1700,"For instance, you don't need to check pairs where both numbers are greater than `sqrt(sum(range(n)))`"
1699,which for large `n` should cut out a lot of pairs
1700,"I win a big chunk of time by removing the `list` from  `list(itertools.combinations(numbers, 2))` as it's not usefull"
1700,"What's the complexity of the naive approach? `sum(range(n))` is `n(n-1)/2`, and then by comparing all pairs, you check `n(n-1)/2 * n(n-1)/2` pairs; So the complexity is essentially `O(n**4)`?; `n**2*(n-1)**2/4` pairs to check"
1700,let's say that `n` will not exceed 1k
1700,"By checking for `(first  &lt; sqrt(sum(range(n)))) and (second &lt; sqrt(sum(range(n))))`, you can reduce that to..."
1700,"but anyway, from what I was leaving it, I do not know if it comes `n` to until 1k.
I suspect that the max is much lower."
1700,"If I'm not wrong, even if n=1000 that still requires checking 249500250000 pairs of numbers"
1700,"Well, that's a lot.
But as I said, I do not think it ever came to n = 1000.
I think it's going to be hard to make it halfway. (n=500); for research purposes, let's set it for not more than 300.; not only do you worry about the speed of action. If, for example, I have to check with 50 x `n` where `n` &lt; 100; for this, this function should be as fast as possible"
1700,It also depends what is as fast as possible. Maybe there are solutions in C library
1700,"I do not say that it must be done in this way, it is completely different solution that will give the desired result; oki, then how this need looks?; I'm just learning this fascinating language and I can not get everything in flight yet.; Any hint how it should look like? :slightly_smiling_face:"
1700,"Your code earlier looked really nice. On the whole, list comprehensions are much faster than `for` loops, so I think your first answer looked pretty good. Like <@Ciera> suggested, you can remove the `list`structure"
1700,"oki, <@Ciera>, <@Fabiola> thanks for your help :slightly_smiling_face:; :+1:"
1700,"You can use the `itertools.product` to find combinations of the `range(n*(n-1)/2)` and `range(np.sqrt(n*(n-1)/2)`; And because the product is symmetric, at the end you can reverse all the pairs you have found and add them to the solution set; ie. if `(a, b)` is a solution, then so is `(b, a)`."
1700,"nice; Check it out as soon as I find a moment because now I am at work :slightly_smiling_face: and will certainly write back what I sent. Once again, thanks a lot for your help"
1700,"Yeah, me too, it's an interesting problem! I'll try an run some of my own benchmarks to see if my calculations reflect reality ^^; And <@Hipolito> you can give tacos to people if you found them helpful  :taco:"

1701,"Hi all,
Has anybody successfully bundled OpenCV and PyQt using PyInstaller on OSX?  I’m having a nightmare getting it to work.    Everything works perfectly before bundling with PyInstaller, however when I run the app created by PyInstaller I get the following error:; If I comment out the ‘import cv2’ the app works (but without the opencv functionality obviously)"
1701,"IIRC, opencv dependencies are a pita to make portable"
1701,Is there a better alternative?
1701,I just installed the deps using a linux vm; and added the python binaries via a virtualenv
1701,I am attempting to create a short video file from individual image frames; Installing deps on a linux vm won’t help me build an OSX app though will it?
1701,"nope; so, with this, seems like its worth escalating to the pyinstaller repostitory issue page or going to the opencv mailing list"
1701,Ok will do.  Thanks for the indo!; *Info
1701,"good luck :slightly_smiling_face:; that said, there are a number of projects where packaging is a pain, I feel; opencv is one; gis is another (geodjango, etc); and depending on the machine/OS, numpy/scipy, pandas…"
1702,Probably best asking in the <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel
1702,"oh yeah, my bad haha"
1702,:grinning:
1702,"Update to my logging question, I got logging to work. 
```logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
new_event_logger = logging.getLogger(f'{__name__}.new_member')
all_event_logger = logging.getLoggeR(f'{__name__}.all_events')```
config file: <https://github.com/OperationCode/operation_code_pybot/blob/master/utils/log_config.json>"
1701,But right now both sub loggers are duplicating the file.
1701,FYI you can also use yaml for the config file (can be more readdable :slightly_smiling_face: )
1701,I saw that; I'm kind of regretting the json
1701,there is a key to deactivate that
1701,So both `new_event_logger` and `all_event_logger` have the same data.
1701,see <https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-pythondev/blob/master/config/prod.config.yml#L96>; ah no you already have it
1701,"` ""disable_existing_loggers"": false,`; Maybe something to do with root?"
1701,the root logger use both handlers; how do you log a message ? `<http://all_event_logger.info|all_event_logger.info>('my log')` ?
1701,Yes
1701,I'm not a pro on logging but your config seems fine to me :confused:
1701,"maybe something to do with my setup function?; <https://github.com/OperationCode/operation_code_pybot/blob/master/utils/log_manager.py>; Not sure if I need to have ```logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
new_event_logger = logging.getLogger(f'{__name__}.new_member')``` within that file"
1701,you shouldn't use `__name__` there.; name is the python path of the file `mymodule.submodule.filename`; so you don't get the correct logger
1701,Cause I'm using `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler`
1701,you should do `logging.getLogger('my_module.new_member')`
1701,I think that's working better :slightly_smiling_face:
1701,for `all_events` it could be interesting to just set the message in DEBUG mode and log the debug elsewhere; haha I see you also had some trouble with the stupid `Bot ID`. I can't understand why they haven't changed that yet
1701,"I'm not even sure if I need it.; But was working with someone and he included that utility to get the bot id; This first iteration we are just using the RTM, the next step is to turn it into an app so we can incorporate buttons. Do you know if that's something your wrapper can do?"
1701,"the wrapper doesn't handle button by itself but yeah it can handle messages with buttons.; try the `/gif` command to see some buttons :wink:; it's a bit of work to get buttons and commands working correctly as you will need a webserver, Most likely Django, Flask or an async one; you should use `logger.exception(e)` here; <https://github.com/OperationCode/operation_code_pybot/blob/master/src/app.py#L117>; so no need to do the traceback thingy"
1701,"Yeah, probably go with flask at first.; I saw you were working on a curio implementation; I really wanted to learn async using curio first.; Been hearing lots of crap about asyncio"
1701,"I have never really used it, I usually stick to the standard python async; well it works for me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1701,I don't disagree
1701,but I can understand that there is other implementations that are easier to get into

1703,Anyone used `grequests` for async requests?
1703,"I did :slightly_smiling_face:; It's pretty fast, although I had difficulties when a number of URLs reached ~10k; <@Myong> so... what did you have in mind"
1703,"So I've got a webpage where I download some data from the items on the page by sending a request to download a csv, I then have to do an individual request to scrape data from each individual row/item in the csv; So basically just download the csv, grab all the item id's, format them into the url, go to each url and grab the data and store it in a dictionary then put it all into a csv at the end; But first gotta find the request necessary to download the info I need from the csv"
1703,"grequests is suitable for this I think, when you have a hundred URLs"
1703,"Yeah it'll be around that; Just trying to figure out the url to grab this csv....; If I'm not seeing a GET/POST go through on downloading this file, what exactly can I do to get the file to actually download? Basically just cant find the URL"

1704,"Hi everyone, I'm having somewhat of a weird issue : when doing a docker-compose up I get the following error message : WARNING: no logs are available with the 'syslog' log driver

1704,"Short Question: Is it possible to use a MS Office file as a source to render a webpage with one of the web frameworks? If so, what would you use? (I am looking for a simple yes/no on the possible question. And if possible, just direct me to the package/module and I'll read the docs from there...)

Long Version: Our IT dept keeps our documentation in a bunch of MS office files. It is all quite well organized and standardized. A directory for each area of IT (network, storage, vmware, voip, etc). Each folder has a single .docx, a .xlsx, and a .vsdx.
The issue we run into is that we rarely update but frequently reference. Since we all have RW permissions to the files, whenever we open one of them, it locks the file so no one else can edit. So, whenever we have to make an edit, we have to find who has it open and ask them to close it.
Its not enough of a bother for anyone else to have done anything about it, much less be willing to spend anything on a better solution.
So, my thinking is that if I could use my django server (on which I am still learning...) to host a webapp that would render a page from each of those files, we could use that as reference and only open the file when we need to make an update. 

My general thoughts on the high level program would be as follows:
1. point the program at the root directory. 
2. it would generate links for each folder, once clicked, it would display another set of links for subdirs or files. If files, it would display a page rendered with the content of the office file. If folder, display links to folder contents, rinse repeate.

I dont know how to do any of this, yet. I'll figure it out.
What I am looking for is if it is even possible to render a page with Django using a MS Office file as a source.
If I know I can do that, I'll figure out the rest. 
If that is not possible, I wont be wasting my time trying to figure it out...

Thank you for any input!"

1719,and I suspect that’s the difference; powershell and bash are different beasts entirely
1719,ya...PowerShell says `Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.` after `ssh-add -l`
1719,Whenever I run into this it's always my ssh agent not having the loaded key from a restart or something; That part I can't help with on powershell though but hopefully it points you in the right direction
1721,"*def _execute(self, request):*
this function is protected or private ?; how can i import it in some other class."
1721,"it's technically neither as we don't have those things in python; assuming your new class extends the class that owns `_execute`, you'll have access to it on the instance-level"
1721,"can i import this function 
or i have to import its class and then make an object of that class to call this function"
1721,"<@Gemma> have you seen if __name__ == ""__main__"" in python before?
<http://thepythonguru.com/what-is-if-__name__-__main__/>"
1721,"<@Gemma> it's not a function, it's a class method, so you'd have to have an instance of the class to use the method; methods belong to classes and are unusable (for the most part) outside of their class's instances"
1721,"<@Frieda> you've done this before, and I'm guessing your spidey sense/experience knows that's his angle, but what did you key in ?; (versus where I'm going with it)"
1721,"<@Seema> uh, just that it's obviously an instance method (`self` in the signature) and asking about ""some other class"""
1721,he said import and that's what I was keying on
1721,"i mean, maybe?"
1721,"<@Devorah> I guess am reading it wrong, but from what I can see from the text you pasted
`Your output` has 1 space less preceeding 00000000Ruthy and Anderson as compared to `Expected output`"
1721,"<@Gemma> when you say import, do you mean how do you get an instance of that class to use or do you mean from one python script/file to another?"
1721,from one python script to another.
1721,you'll still need to do what kennethlove was saying but first visit that link and it will explain the key to import from one script to another
1721,<@Gemma> in that case you won't import that method but the whole class itself and instantiate the class into a var and then call the _execute method on that var in your python script
1721,"okay let me try that 
thanks all  <@Frieda> <@Miguelina> <@Seema> :slightly_smiling_face:"
1722,"<@Miguelina> do you see why it's doing that? I can't figure out why it's doing that, it should be a fixed length field with 16 for first and 16 for last and 8 for birthdate"
1722,<@Devorah> can you replace `workers = workers[:(XX+15)] + B.strip() + workers[(XX+24):]` with `workers = workers[:(XX+15)] + B + workers[(XX+24):]` and see
1721,"<@Devorah> by default strip will remove white spaces before and after your string
```
In [9]: foo = ' Hello '

In [10]: bar = foo.strip()

In [11]: foo
Out[11]: ' Hello '

In [12]: bar
Out[12]: 'Hello'
```"
1721,with it removed it's still adding a space
1721,hmm; <@Devorah> can you tell me what exactly is the goal of the exercise? you wanna search and replace something?

can i create object of class me simply *anybody=me()*

1721,"just to be clear,do you want to inherit or create an instance of a class?; in the case of Person, you might want an instance me, you, him, her, but then you might want to have a different behavior and inherit from person into baby and include a method for pooping pants; (anyone can poop their pants, it's the best example I could come up with on the spot :\)"
1721,<@Gemma> take a look at this <http://eflorenzano.com/blog/2008/05/04/inheritance-vs-composition/> might help you in choosing what path to take
1721,ok thanks guys
1721,"<@Devorah> you could just use regex's to find F, L and replace B"
1721,I'm not there yet <@Miguelina> how would I do that?
1721,"without knowing all the details I can't give the exact code but would look something like this
```
import re

```; will need to try it out a bit and tweak it maybe"
1721,cool will do thanks!

1725,"Hey has anyone seen a nice tutorial or guide on how to make haystack facets work?
Its more of the rendering side i'm struggling with, facet data is being collected I just cant render to templates
The documentation is not the best."
1721,"With that kind of stuff I’ve found it’s usually best just to dive into the source and look, because yeah the docs aren’t so hot.  :confused:"
1726,"Hey guys I have a json data that looks like this after using `json.dumps(data)`: `{\""id\"": 5, \""first_name\"": \""b\"", \""last_name\"": \""b\"", \""email\"": \""<mailto:b@gmail.com|b@gmail.com>\"", \""username\"": \""bb\"", \""date_joined\"": \""2017-12-05T16:49:22.527214+00:00\"", \""country\"": \""a\"", \""goal\"": \""a\"", \""mobile_number\"": \""a\""}""`; I want to take out all the `\`; how do i do that since `'\'` isn't allowed in `.replace()`"
1726,it doesn't allow `\`? you'd think there'd be an escape character (ex. `\\`) but im pretty new
1726,Yes `\` is the escape but when I tried to replace `\\` it didn't work :disappointed:
1726,"It’s just “ signs , they are escaped because the whole string here is wrapped with “”; Try print(json.dumps(data))"
1726,are you printing that out?; or is it just displaying in the shell
1726,so the solution was `json.loads(json.dumps(dict))` haha
1726,huh?
1726,that feels unintuitive though haha
1726,you never answered my question though; you’re just loading the dict back into a dict after dumping to json; so what does `print(json.dumps(data))` look like?
1726,yeah its super weird hold on i'll upload pics; This one using `json.dumps(user_details)`
1726,what is `user_details`? Looks like you're dumping a string to a string
1726,"its a dictionary; So i guess it makes sense, I json-ified the dict then made it readable using `json.loads`"
1726,"what are you trying to do?; because if you’re printint the data out to a template, you don’t need to do the json stuff; and if you’re logging to file, you don’t need that either; basically, I think you’re driving yourself into an area of confusion about something that has zero relevance"
1726,story of my life
1726,"<@Meg> sorry for the late reply, the data being presented by the endpoint included the `\\` and I just wanted to remove it to make the front end api calls easier."
1727,Would it be worth it to multi-thread a computationally heavy for loop with 3000+ iterations that takes 20+ minutes to complete?
1727,how often do you need to do this?
1727,Once a day; Or should I just be creating a bunch of workers
1727,really depends- do you care that it takes 20m? :)
1727,"I’d go the multiprocessing route over threading, but yeah, like <@Joann> said - depends how much you care; could be a good excuse to try the technique though"
1727,Currently sitting at my desk awaiting completion so I got 20 minutes lol
1727,heh; I mean if it’s something you have to wait for the result for then I’d say yes.  How many cores does your machine have?
1727,"if the work you're doing is cpu bound I'm not sure if traditional multi-threading will help that much, wouldn't it be stuck on one core anyway?"
1727,8 total with hyperthreading
1727,"huh? no; well, idk what you mean by 'traditional multi-threading' to be fair, but Linux threads will certainly get you access to multiple CPUs..."
1727,In pure cpython you are block by the GIL
1727,I meant python threads vs a library like multi processing
1727,<@Antionette> I believe `ThreadPoolExecutor` works properly
1727,you need to drop in C or use multiprocessing
1727,"oh, ugh, forgot which slack I was on. :); silly python"
1727,"Multithreading for IO bound, Multiprocess for CPU bound"
1727,really good talk about concurrency in python <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zinZmE3Ogk> :slightly_smiling_face:
1727,IIRC; How many processes should I have running at once?
1727,"with 8 HTs, I'd probably try 10; you could time that and then vary the # of processes and see if there's much change"
1727,n° of core + 1 is the rule I heard but I don't really know :smile:
1727,"it really depends on a lot of different things, heh."
1727,yeah; very hard even to estimate
1727,The difference is likely to be relatively small in total runtime anyway tho.
1727,but it's easy to shoot yourself in the foot and make parallel code work slower than one-core-one-thread; RE: multiprocessing communication overhead
1727,Now the attempt to get `tqdm` to work with this
1727,<@Myong> Looks like you can afford to spend about a day or two on this before you wipe out any gains in time you make over a year: <https://xkcd.com/1205/>; Assuming you shave 5-10 minutes off the task
1727,haha nice chart :smile:
1727,relevant xkcd!
1727,I like how some are greyed out. Like `you should have already done it` :smile:; today's one was kind of happy/sad
1727,oh no
1727,"wow, yeah, hadn't read it yet"
1727,"<@Myong> have you checked your time-complexity, for example, do you have inner and outer for loops?  also have you profiled the code at all?"
1727,Yeah I ran a profile on it; It's basically a word likeness algorithm that runs on a few thousand inputs
1727,"<@Myong> I don't know what the task is, but would it be possible to run it as a cron job before you need it, so you're not actually waiting for it?"
1727,It spends about 97% of the time inside a single function
1727,Or is it something you need to run on up to date data when you get it?
1727,hope it's not the slow Levenstein
1727,It's useing `FuzzyWuzzy`; <https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy>
1727,it might be a good opportunity to learn cython :smile:
1727,You could be correct; I'm just not busy at work and trying to improve this little script
1727,"""cheap"" ways to *potentially* increase speed are to compile the program or try pypy, though reference that time chart for pypy :wink:"
1727,Okay I'll check it out
1727,yeah pypi is a good idea :thumbsup:
1727,"lol, I can never get the name right"
1727,the python package index?; Oh I got confused for a sec
1727,"pypy is a python compiled python interpreter, no C underneath"
1727,haha no I go it wrong you got it right <@Seema>
1727,lol
1727,what's happenin
1727,wait isnt that pypy?; LOL
1727,I'm confused
1727,<https://pypy.org/> != <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>
1727,"right, so i'm not having a stroke; that's good"
1727,what a rush; <@Ciera> so <http://pypy.org|pypy.org> and download the interpreter?
1727,!= <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pipi>; yeah with a bit of luck it should automagically work
1727,it shouldn’t?  :stuck_out_tongue:
1727,Hopefully im not lucky
1727,"*IIRC*, you need python to use C to use python to create the python interpreter so not as easy as ""download the interpreter"", you'll need to build it.  Last I saw it was a long build time.; can someone tell me I'm wrong and that you can download it?"
1727,it's late here :coffee: :cry:
1727,I have a download im looking at here
1727,I think there’s a binary distribution for it.
1727,BUT Idk
1727,"at the very least, you'll learn a lot :slightly_smiling_face:"
1727,Looks like they have SVM here <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/>
1727,Where are you at?
1727,I'm in belgium. It's not that late but it's getting dark
1727,"My brother-in-law lived there for 10+ years, he's from California so there was a bit of weather shock.  He loved it otherwise.; I think he lived in Leuven, spoke Dutch and English, had to learn French"
1727,yeah the weather is not too good at the moment :disappointed:; Leuven is pretty nice.
1727,he tells the story of over a 100 days of no sun and he had an upcoming bike trip
1727,haha 100 days of no sun is a bit exagerated :smile: we are not England
1727,"just as he goes on his trip, the sun opens up for 5 or 6 days and he has this glorious ride and then it goes back to cloudy, he said the whole country kinda slumps"
1727,well it's a shithole afterall :trollface: :trump:
1727,are you Belgian?
1727,yeah. I was born in France but moved to belgium when I was 12
1727,Alright about to try it out
1727,where are you at ? I suppose US west ?
1727,"northern California, east of San Francisco; it's been 4 to 16 degrees out here and I'm not use to this, I'm from southern california; I have thermals and ear muffs , often in the house"
1727,is that °F or °C ?
1727,C
1727,ah yeah that's pretty cool for California; it's around 0° here; you don't have good heating in the house ? More focused on cooling usually ?
1727,"brrr, I live on the way to the mountains so if I was a skiing fan this would be great, about 2 hours to some great slopes.  Too bad I can't deal with the cold.; Most of the houses in US are old double-pane windows that no longer hold the insulation, often about 2000square feet, so the heaters are kind of useless, the concern in most of the state is air conditioning"
1727,yeah well I guess in the south temperature are usually higher.
1727,"It's highly variable too, in San Francisco, you might never use your heater but a couple of weeks a year because the proximity to the ocean keeps the temperature even"
1727,at least in Belgium house have good insulation and heating; but then in the summer when there is a bit of sun nobody can handle it
1727,"central california is a giant, and I mean HUGE valley, easily ges in the 100s.... errr 40+, part of southern california too but the closer to the beach, the less craziness, the more expensive, nice community,etc"
1727,I couldn't deal with 40+ :smile:
1727,is air conditioning a normal thing to have?
1727,"no, nobody has it"
1727,"that's interesting, how many times a year would you say it's needed?"
1727,you would only use it for a few weeks over the year. nt worth it
1727,"Seattle is like that and they've been having warm, dry summers.  My (ex) co-workers were miseable, weeks of hot, muggy, no relief, no way to cool at night; you working on any interesting projects?"
1727,yeah it's usually like that. But temp rarely reach 30; Average should be about 24-25 in the summer
1727,that's nice!
1727,"Yeah I was working on making our postgresql replicate, and before that on a SIP server with asyncio; pretty cool stuff to do; and you ?"
1727,"lately, tinkering, I'm hobbyist not full-time programmer.  I've been playing with Dask <http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/>; Also, been trying to figure out how I can level up, my decorators, metaclasses, context managers, properties knowledge is non-existent; do you roll your own SIP?"
1727,"I don't really know anything about datascience / analytics in python but it looks interesting :smile:; well it's always by doing that you learn, there is no secret."
1727,TRUE
1727,No but we have the need for a custom SIP server/proxy in some specific cases
1727,"I used to manage the VOIP and the Lync servers, some of that stuff is black magic, some of it cool, most of it a pain"
1727,If you haven't already watched them I can recommend all the raymond hettinger talks
1727,"I like his, then I'll balance it with a Dave Beazley talk just to keep it light, lol"
1727,Most of it was a pain to do :smile: but we got something working. It's not perfect but does the job; <https://github.com/Eyepea/aiosip>
1727,"""proto-duction"""
1727,David Beazley is like the crazy uncle of python; I have to go. talk to you later :wave:
1727,take it easy; o/
1727,Alright installed the binaries but there is no actual binary anywhere
1727,start a new shell session?
1727,On Windows fyi (save me). But it's nowhere at all let me see if this works gonna download one of the newer binaries; ahhh there it is
1727,"ah, no idea about windows.  :slightly_smiling_face:"
1727,Yeah I got it. I guess I downloaded the source but for some reason there was no distinction between the two
1728,Alright im excited to see how this works with  pypy; just as slow so far in pypy as normal python build; :disappointed:
1729,"Hello, I've got a celery worker that runs task that involves calling `subprocess.check_call(cmd)`. The cmd is a Python script. Is it possible to debug it using Pycharm inside a Celery worker debugger?"
1728,Sweet! Implemented multiprocess and the speed has doubled so far non pypy
1728,"<@Myong> play around with it, I've even heard of things initially going slower on pypy before going MANY times faster; nice"
1728,Worth running on pypy with multiprocessing?
1728,"<@Mirian> if you set `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = True` in settings, then the worker will run synchronously and you’ll be able to debug in pycharm"
1727,"but not sure whether you’d be able to hook into the subprocess.  that might be best left as a standalone debug, where your inputs match those from the subprocess call"
1728,"that's a good question (euphemism for I don't actually know), though pypy is an interpreter with a GIL, I would imagine you'd see improvements; do tell how it turns out if you do"
1728,okay about to start
1728,"I can debug celery worker itself, just cannot figure out how to setup breakpoints within Python script executed with subprocess; debugging the rest of the code works :slightly_smiling_face:"
1728,the problem is that the subprocess runs on an entirely different process than what the debugger is attached to
1728,there is a settings `attach to subprocess automatically while debugging` <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/python-debugger.html>; but maybe it's an external process; and I've misunderstood that
1728,I’ve never had any success with that; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1728,"anyway, thanks for the tips <@Meg> :taco:"
1728,Moment of truth for pypy w/multiprocessing
1730,"<@Seema> Starting out as fast as normal python interpreter w/out MP, but im gonna let it run the full length and see what happens"
1728,It's slowly going up. 10% through and its gone from 1.5 it/s to 2.35 it/s and keeps climbing
1730,cool; what are you using to display the number of iterations per second?
1730,`tqdm`!; Awesome library for progress bar; And I just found the code to work alongside multiprocessing
1730,"seems like a win, take the rest of the week off!  lol j/k"
1730,That's what I'm saying
1730,pypy often requires warming up; such is life with JIT
1730,Just read up on JIT so now I understand; <@Seema> half way through at 2.65 it/s so about 35% slower than normal python atm both w/MP; Time for cython?
1730,that's a strange result
1730,could I possibly have too many workers?; I have 8 total cores and 10 workers; should i drop it down and see what happens
1730,"<@Myong> how does the pool communicate with the main process?; do you submit something to the pools, or just tell it where to read from, or..?"
1730,"I submit them with list comprehension; `futures = [executor.submit(self.find_match, radio) for radio in self.missing_list]`"
1730,and what's the typical size of the submitted data?
1730,It's a string usually no longer than ~20 characters
1730,"huh; I'm not 95% sure it's a communication overhead; each piece of data needs to be serialized, transmitted to the process, and deserialized. And then the same when the process finishes and communicates the result back"
1730,Its just weird cause the normal interpreter improved ~80% from the MP
1730,maybe PyPy was already fast so less room for improvement?; what if you submitted a chunk of data each time? like a hundred entries or so
1730,Difference in speed is `2.55 it/s vs 3.9 it/s`
1730,too much fuel in the carb! lol
1730,ugh now `with open()` in pypy can't take the `newline=''` argument
1730,mine does :open_mouth:
1730,:disappointed:
1731,how is it going?
1731,"I haven't run it in a bit, but it was still running around 2.7 it/s"
1731,:disappointed:; is it public code?
1730,<@Meg> I've figured it out! This script was an setup.py's script and I've changed it to the actual path of the file
1731,and it now magically works; but I'm not sure why :stuck_out_tongue:
1732,It is not. It's just a small script that deals with data that's not very sensitive. I'm gonna profile it again on pycharm w/PyPy
1732,alright
1732,"<@Suellen> huh, I just found something interesting; downloaded the 3.5 version binaries, but python 2.7 installed..."
1732,how did you install and invoke python?
1732,So Installed it from their nightly py3.5 branch here; <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3.5/>; I downloaded the top most `pypy-c-jit-latest-win32.zip`
1732,"and when you type python, 2.7 comes up?"
1732,"When I go into the directory; And open up pypy.exe; I see python 2.7.13; `Python 2.7.13 (5ef9bb870cd2, Dec 14 2017, 07:11:07)`"
1732,:open_mouth:
1732,How does that work lmao
1732,very cruel joke on their part
1732,I cant find the stable release binaries...
1732,what about earlier releases like <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3.5/pypy-c-jit-93274-44b347a2f013-win32.zip>
1732,There is only the source that you have to build yourself and it looks quite extensive; And 502 error on their site lol; Downloading now
1732,very bad luck lol; you should buy a lottery ticket
1732,LOL; So I somehow did download 2.7; Cause this one has `pypy3.exe` as opposed to the one I have now `pypy.exe`
1732,"kbman, I'm not going to ""should"" you because I've been where you are.

1732,Okay so since tuples are immutable you wont be able to touch the values. You can grab them though and place them into a list
1732,I was looking into functools but couldn’t quite think of something without using for loops
1732,There's an easier way that's a bit cleaner one sec
1732,Yea I mean returns new list not change the existing one
1732,So say you wanna subtract 2 from each value

1736,"What's everyone's opinion on the following (complex) scenario:

I am building a platform which retrieves order data of multiple webshops, those orders have different suppliers (depending on the products).

Each of these suppliers have complete different API's. Expect data to be mapped differently and have different features. For example:

Supplier #1 has ""Post Order"" (POST to API), ""Get Stock"" (from FTP), ""Get Order Status"" (from FTP).
Supplier #2 has ""Post Order"" (SOAP WSDL), ""Get Stock"" (SOAP WSDL).
Supplier #3 has ""Post Order"" (Through E-mail)

We have a ""BaseSupplier"" class right now, and want every feature to be a mixin (""PostOrderMixin"", ""GetStockMixin"", ""GetOrderStatusMixin""). However, these Mixins still just have abstract functions because the actual implementation for a supplier is so different. But I'm not really able to move forward on this right now because it's starting to feel ugly..

How would you design this?"
1733,"I think your approach is appropriate, abstract the stuff you can, mixin the stuff that needs tweaking.  I have a story that goes with this...; <@Casie> so my dad once worked as a buyer and the problem was that all the suppliers had their own way they supplied the data.  The product was a commodity so buying was mostly based on availability and price and not features; he implemented an ingest system and said to the suppliers, ""this is our system, here are the tools to adhere, we'll even teach you, if you don't adhere, we will buy from the other companies that do.""; there was a bunch of squabbling but my dad's company won because a) they were a big buyer and b) the tech the companies were offering was awful (word docs, xeroxed sheets, faxes(!))"
1733,"<@Seema> nice story! hehe, yeah it's really weird seeing all these suppliers holding on their own outdated stacks and tools; I'll try to build a little further on the design I had in mind and see how it goes :slightly_smiling_face:"

1742,"My problem says - #

1742,for me my model is a MySQL server so i can just make a direct SQL query for the freshys
1742,but when I import it locally it's giving me the \n and when I .rsplit it's not stripping it
1742,or i can analyze the request and pull from cache depending
1742,hmmmm; you can iterate easily over the lines of the files

   for line in f:
      print(line)"
1742,"keep you API totally decoupled, just parses a route and makes a data request"

1742,then your ETL system handles making sure you get the right data

   for i, line in enumerate(f):

The concept is very simple - download image from azure blob storage -&gt; resize -&gt; apply some filters -&gt; response.  So I used Flask for the first prototype, after few load tests I realized that we need something asynchronous, so I switched to Tornado. But the problem of overloading still persists, I have only ~77% success requests for 250 concurrent users, which is sad (I use visual studio online load tests). I use single core VM for testing, on another similar VM I run our existing resizer written in C#, which handles loads perfectly with 100% request rate (tho single request is much slower). The logs don't have any failed requests, which means that the failed requests didn't even come into the web server request pool... I use docker container BTW, and odd thing is that CPU has ~65% load idle, tho the python processes consume 0% idle... This is my first ever web Python experience, so I'm frustrated a little bit, may be some help would be appreciated. Could it be a problem of Tornado? Docker? Should I try Sanic or japronto? Should I use another layer over built in web server in Tornado?"

Dialogs contain a variety of guided input types.`; Do you know of a way to turn the `team_join` event into an event with a `trigger_id`; So I can send new users a modal instead of private message?"

1751,"`pyenv update &amp;&amp; pyenv install 3.7-dev`
too tricky :o"
1751,well there is the shims and stuff like that
1751,"they are implementation details a user isn't supposed to touch; at least, I know I've never touched shims at all; and PyCharm discovers pyenv virtualenvs on its own, which is nice"
1752,well for example it's not working out of the box with tox <https://www.holger-peters.de/using-pyenv-and-tox.html>; it's not really a big trouble and I use it daily but for a beginner it might be too abstract
1751,"well, Tox expects to find all python versions on PATH, so some changes are necessary; for example you do:
`pyenv local 3.4.3 3.5.2 3.6.4 3.7.0`; and Tox will work OK after that; not ideal of course"
1752,I'd really like to avoid passing the slack client all over the place
1753,something like a singleton?
1753,I guess so
1753,"i personally don't like singletons, too much shared state initialized *somewhere* in the code. Moreover i think the way i wrote the above function is easier to test too. Still, if you're ok with a singleton it should work :slightly_smiling_face:"
1753,"What about creating a decorator; `@pass_instance_object` or something; Trying to get better at unit tests. Currently have this function I want to check: ```def combined_route_director(json_data: dict, required_key: str) -&gt; None:

    # test_route_handler(json_data)```; Tests are passing, but I want to make sure that I'm not making them pass by doing it wrong."
1753,i don't think it'll solve the problem. Just shifting the responsibility to find the client instance to the decorator
1754,"Hey guys I have a list of strings from a separate string that I split, but in some cases if the string contains typos where they dont include spaces my script will not catch it. I want to essential turn a list that looks like this `['[usa-az][h]paypal', '[w]', 'gtx', '1080', 'ti', 'and', 'gtx', '1070']` into this `['[usa-az]', '[h]', 'paypal', '[w]', 'gtx', '1080', 'ti', 'and', 'gtx', '1070']`"
1754,"do you need those square brackets?; if not, you can always remove them/add space and it would make splitting easier I guess"
1754,Scraping reddit uh?; Also use regular expression to isolate your patterns
1754,Yeah just looking for regex for `]`; Guess it's just `\]`
1754,"it's difficult for me to contrast the the two lists, you can use triple tilda to make code blocks in slack"
1754,I cannot figure out this regex lol
1754,show us
1754,"<@Suellen> `re.findall('\[[a-z\-a-z]+[a-z]\]', l[0])` for this string `'[usa-az][h]paypal'`; It gives me `[usa-az]` but nothing else; I've just never really used regex; so not sure; This one matches everything except the string on the end it gives nothing 
`re.findall('(\[.*?\])|(\].*?)', l[0])`; Just need to figure out what to put instead of `|` to match the other string on the end"
1755,"Will the string always be in the same format?; `r""\[\w{3}\-\w{2}\]\[\w\]\w+""`"
1754,The thing about it is this is a type; so typo; so if its in the correct format I dont need to touch it; I need to separate them
1755,You want them as separate groups?
1754,yeah; `\[.*?\]|\]` this works; in `re.findall`
1754,and is this the entire string? `'[usa-az][h]paypal'`
1754,Yeah that will be the input
1754,with the quote marks?
1754,"no quotes sorry; `\[.*?\]` finds the two strings with brackets; so it returns `['[usa-az]', '[h]']`; oops"
1754,And what do you want it to return?
1754,"But I cant figure out how to find the string on the end so basically `]paypal` bit dont include the closing bracket; I want the two previous strings plus `paypal`; `['[usa-az]', '[h]', 'paypal']`"
1754,`(?P&lt;group_1&gt;\[\w{3}\-\w{2}\])\[\w\](?P&lt;group_2&gt;\w+$)`
1754,doesn't find the `[h]`
1754,I thought you said you didnt want the h?; oh ok sorry i just saw
1754,"No worries; The only thing though, not sure if it will always be 3 character a dash then two characters, what can I use to match any number of character? Just `\w`; ?; Or +"
1754,"What are the possible combinations?; This should work; `r""(?P&lt;group_1&gt;\[\w{1,3}\-\w{1,3}\])(?P&lt;group_2&gt;\[\w\])(?P&lt;group_3&gt;\w+$)""`"
1754,Got it!

1754,Yep same here
1754,woo
1754,There are so many ways people could make mistakes in the title this is gonna be fun
1755,how do you mean?
1754,So basically the title format is `[location]` then `[h]` then whatever else followed by `[w]` and other stuf; But in some cases people do or dont include spaces; And it can be mixed and matches; matched
1754,Where is the data coming from?
1754,Reddit; It's submission titles; Just building a notifier for /r/hardwareswap; It works but cant deal with badly formatted titles
1754,"hmm, probably better to make the regex more flexible"
1754,Yeah
1754,are all of the submissions inside square brackets?
1754,Yes they have to be
1754,ok that helps
1754,so if they're not they get taken down and im not worried about that; So the reason I'm doing this is to check if the item you are looking for is being sold or is wanted; I only want stuff being sold; So I check if the index of  the item is between the indexes of [h] and [w] that way I know it's being sold
1754,I see
1754,It only becomes an issue if the item is in the format like `[h]1070 gtx[w]...`
1754,But there's no kind of validation; Still think there's a way with regex to filter it
1754,"Yeah; I can always just grab the item the person wants; and see if the starting point of the string is between the start of the want and have tag; that might be easier; Lol; Instead of splitting it up; But then I have to check if the string occurs both before and after, but in that case it doesn't matter I can just grab the first occurence"
1754,I'm not sure how the input is received
1754,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32430620/python-string-search-starting-from-a-specific-position-within-a-string>; It's received as a simple string; I split it
1754,"On the r/hardware site now; Ok so people just put it in the title; `[USA-FL] [H] Paypal [W] Dell u2718q, Cablemods (black and white) for EVGA PSU`"
1754,Yup
1754,Ok the good thing is they all look formatted in a similar way
1754,Yeah the only thing is the spaces
1754,does the [h] mean payment method right?
1754,It differentiates between have and want
1754,"they all seem to be formatted like `[h]paypal`; or in this case `[H] Paypal, Local Cash [W] Used 1080/1080Ti`; This should take care of any white spaces..; ```import re

test_str = ""[USA-MD] [H] Paypal [W] Bluetooth mouse""

regex = r""\[(?P&lt;country&gt;\w+)\-(?P&lt;state&gt;\w+)\]\s?\[H\](?P&lt;payment_methods&gt;.*)\[W\]\s?(?P&lt;wants&gt;.*$)""

1756,Getting a `Runtime Error: dictionary changed size during iteration`; Basically iterating through the dictionary and popping off keys that dont pass a certain `if` statement; I tried to create a temp dict but didnt work; I made a list comprehension that does the same thing; lets see if it works

1756,Got it to work
1756,Rather than pop as you iterate
1756,"Was thjis; now `return {k: v for k, v in match_dict.items() if have_index &lt; v &lt; want_index}`; No issues so far lets see if this beast works"
1756,tasty
1756,One thing I still haven't figured out about list comprehensions and such is when to use if at the end or before the `for` portion.
1756,Think you always use it after for as its a conditional statement; But i could be wrong; I know you can get pretty complex with some of these comprehensions
1756,Yeah I did one earlier that nearly took two lines lol
1756,haha
1756,They're satisfying when you get them right; I remember my professor gave extra points when I first really got into python for doing list comps so that's all I ever did
1756,Yeah totally; They can really condense a lot of code into a nice one liner
1757,"I did something with that sub. Also used regex to get what i needed.

1766,"ok, that’s why"
1766,"Yes, I'm a DBA who wants to learn Python"
1766,"ok, so you know the difference between terminal and db shell; what you need to do with the above is write in the terminal, not the shell"

1766,"Yes, the basis stuff from teach your kids how to program with python and automate the boring stuff... Idle worked for what I needed it to. I also used anaconda notebook to query a sql database"
1766,OK so you should get yourself familiar with executing python files from the terminal
1766,"no, that’s the python shell"
1766,You don'r run a pip command from within the python terminal

1766,yes
1766,yes
1766,type `exit()` into the python console; Then from the terminal of your machine. run `pip install virtualenv`

1769,Yeah you're probably correct.; I'm just unsure how to go about doing it. Can I load the iterator into a separate variable then open an output file and write the rows to the csv?
1769,"well I guess you can; StringIO or something like that, which is a ""file"", but in memory"
1769,"Found what might be an answer to the issue where someone had to wrap `iter_lines()` with `codecs.iterdecode()`; <@Suellen> it worked with the `codes.iterdecode(r.iter_lines(), 'utf-8')`; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/38677619> second answer.; Got it to work writing the iterator directly to the file; Sweet; That works as well; Guessing the writing to csv takes care of formatting with newlines and delimiters"

1773,"you'd basically be doing `int([""2"", ""2""])`"
1773,"no, that won't work because you can't turn a list into an int"
1773,you need to pull each value out
1773,got it; wait im sorry i'm still a little confused; been working with rust recently so my understanding of python is out of whack
1773,No problem what's up
1773,i need to try to keep the variable names the same so they work with the code at the bottom
1773,"Okay; just take input in a different variable like `coord_input = input(""Enter coordinates (x, y)"")`; Then do the following; `start_pos = start_x, start_y = [int(x) for x in coord_input.split("","")]`"

1773,"So if someone inputs ""2,2,2"" you will get a list of [2,2,2]"
1773,we need the for loop to extract the ints
1773,"Yeah it's just a clean way to do a for loop; So it iterates over the items returned by `coord_input.split("","")` which basically splits the strings at the comma; and removes whitespace; It returns a list object; but the items are strings, we want integers"
1773,"i was wondering how it returned a list, because we enclosed it in a list?"
1773,".split just splits the string up, and each actual charcter in the string is placed into the list; so if I did `""my name is kbman"".split("" "")` I'd get `[""my"", ""name"", ""is"", ""kbman""]` back"
1773,ah ok
1773,But it doesn't modify the original string; it simply returns a value
1773,now I could use the same coord_input variable for counter size right?  I can maybe format the message to reference counter size?
1773,You can reassign the variable but when it takes the input the `coord_input` variable is a string of values entered by the user
1773,"right; what would I do for just one value? assuming that whatever the user sends back is going to be a string; agh; I got an error from the split method; ```Enter coordinates of first cell (x, y): (107, 25)

1776,"It looks OK; Not that 1000 lines of stack trace :); well, does it block on close or join?; i.e., if you do a `print('just before join')` and same after join, you could see that it blocks on join or on close; that's expected since it's waiting for all tasks to finish"
1776,Is that mean that a process didn't finish?
1776,not yet; it depends on how long it blocks on close &amp; join; if it's too much maybe something is wrong

When attempting to catch a custom extension of `Exception` that I have raised myself. Google’s results do not seem to relevant; My custom exception:

```
class NoDeletionOccurredError(Exception):
    """"""Exception raised for when no deletions occurred.

    Attributes:
        message -- explanation of the error
    """"""

    def __init__(self, message):
        super(NoDeletionOccurredError, self).__init__(message)
        self.message = message
```

Raising the exception:
```
        if actual_numer_of_rows_deleted == 0:
            raise NoDeletionOccurredError.NoDeletionOccurredError(f""No deletions occured when attempting to delete rule_id {rule_id} for user_id {user_id}"")
```

Catching the Exception
```
    try:
        foo()
    except NoDeletionOccurredError as e:
```; Any thoughts?"
1783,NoDeletionOccurredError or IncorrectNonZeroDeletionsOccurredError?
1783,Pardon.; Copy and paste error; _Fixed_; I wrote two exceptions and both are resulting in this error.
1783,I suspect this is the cause: `raise NoDeletionOccurredError.NoDeletionOccurredError`
1783,"My import looks like this:
`from database import NoDeletionOccurredError`"
1783,your raise and except don't use the same exception it seems
1783,"if I remove the first `NoDeletionOccurredError` and end up with `raise NoDeletionOccurredError`, it believe its just talking about the module itself?; <@Myong> I think you’re right, but I’m not sure where the mismatch is occurring"
1783,"just for good practices, I’d move the custom exception to its own module; and then import it directly; like `from databases.exceptions import NoDeletionOccurredError`"
1783,If you import `NoDeleteOccurredError` and that is the name of a file `NoDeletionOccurredError.py` then you need to use the dot operator to import the exception object/class
1783,that would be clearer about location and responsibility
1783,"You can also `Ctrl-B` in some IDE's to go to the definition of the object. Or right click, go to definition/find references"
1783,"Ok. I’m going to try to read up on:

&gt; then you need to use the dot operator to import the exception object/clas

Get that working and the move onto dd82's suggestion and make a separate module; Ok neat guys! I had my imports in the class that was `raise`ing correct all along, but the imports in my class that was `except` (catching) was incorrect.; So now it looks like

```
from database.NoDeletionOccurredError import NoDeletionOccurredError
from database.IncorrectNonZeroDeletionsOccurredError import IncorrectNonZeroDeletionsOccurredError
```; Thanks guys! I’ll look into doing the separate module now; much appreciated! <@Myong>++ <@Meg>++ <@Suellen>++"

1783,"So I am setting up a postgresql db for the first time and I figured out that it creates a new postgres user that you use to access the interactive shell and if I want to access the db with psycopg2 then I also need to run my python script as the postgres user, however this is annoying given the setup I have in my serer as everything else is running under a different user than postgres, so how does one go about adding another user to the list of what I presume are the authenticated users allowed to sign in to psql with no password?"
1784,you want to edit the `pg_hba.conf` file
1783,<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html>
1784,Alternatively you can create a database level user rather than use a system based user
1783,<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/static/user-manag.html#DATABASE-USERS>
1783,"there is only one user on the server and it is in charge of running everything since this isn't something anyone will be logging into on a regular basis; It is just a few logging scripts I need to run, a small webserver to server up an API and a few daemons, had I known postgres created a user I would of just cheated and written everything under that postgres user but now I'm pretty far down the line and decided now was a good time to learn psql and switch off mysql; Oh that's interesting <@Antionette> that's probably what I want to do"

1785,Trying to hook up a mongo db with a api for my client side to run algorithms. Any best practices/architecture I should take into account?
1786,use postgres
1785,Do you prefer it over Mongodb?
1785,yes
1785,"boo I got Mongo to work. Will look at the docs for Postgres. Any tips on a simple api I can use?; Normally I would google something like this, but wanted to ask people on here to get some feedback. Do not feel like getting hacked."
1785,a simple API for what tho?
1785,currently we have a mongo db instance with user data that needs to call a different db to get a score for a candidate.; So ideally the algorithm db would get information and send back a score for the client side db to show
1785,"you can whip up a custom flask API in no time, dunno how reasonable that is for you; just route http requests directly to an SQL call; i went from 0 python knowledge to a working API in a sunday afternoon; mine in particular just calls stored procedures so i don't have to worry about SQL injection; apache + mod_wsgi + pyenv + flask-restfull"

1787,<@Fabian> I saw this post but is there a way to do it without use ```del``` or ```remove()``` instructions ?
1787,I think the way you used it should work? let me open up a console; yep
1787,<@Fabian> it doesn't work (the way I used). This works on c++.
1787,"i just got it to work on the console; ```&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):
...   if i == 2:
...     i+=2
...     print(i)

&gt;&gt;&gt;```; make sure you're using the right indentation; If anyone is able to help me out with this, I would totally appreciate it"
1787,<@Fabian> the output should be this (c++ on left): <https://i.imgur.com/BXmUZIo.png>; ops. right
1787,ahh then you need to do something different in python
1787,yep.. I will do a while loop. :slightly_smiling_face:
1787,there you go
1787,"<@Fabian> I found a way to do it with the same way of c++:
```
myList = iter(range(10))

    if i == 1:
        myList.__next__()
        myList.__next__()

1788,"is there such a thing as an API schema query, I know API are (loosely) convention based.  Is there some common query to return the schema?"

1788,i could be completely wrong re: swagger; <@Seema> i really doubt there's a standard for that. a lot of people try to hide their API
1788,"or in my case, hey government body with public API, your documentation is meh, just show me your structure"
1788,it'd be awesome if you could do `/api/schema.json` and get a map of the api

1788,just bumping this again now that there's more activity
1788,"which variables and in what manner do you want to use them?; I'm a bit confused about the ingestion, the instr.txt gets opened and read once, correct?  If so, your `while line:` is indented -&gt; performed under the open().  Is that intended for some reason...???"
1788,"I dont think so, it's the variables at the bottom"
1789,"`major_columns, major_rows` etc; so right now, for example, all the arguments to range at the bottom, are undefined apparently"
1789,"okay.... I'm starting to wrap my head around what you're doing, you're attempting to manually, line by line, assign the values"
1788,"use a list accumulator, close out the while loop and then you can iterate through the accumulator.  Or you'd really rather skip the iterator, you can straight assign the values manually"
1789,could you show me an example of what you mean?  how would i assign the values manually?
1789,"```lines = []
with open(""instr.txt"") as f:
  for line in f:
    lines.append(f)
```"
1788,"then you could go with lines[0], lines[1], it's not the most pythonic way but it'll get you there"
1789,"ok I think I can wrap my head around that, may ask you one or two related questions if i get stuck"
1788,"go ahead and ask the room, I may be returning a gift that I forgot to return earlier today (doh!)"
1788,"During the while loop, you're re-assigning the same variable several times without doing anything to them; Might be worth reading the document in. iterating over the lines using a for loop as <@Seema> suggested and making lists of items you need"
1789,anyone has locking experience? this seems quite good: <https://gist.github.com/ionrock/3015700> (it will also delete stale locks)
1788,"thank you guys, ill try screwing with it once I get pycharm to start up"
1789,Probably worth throwing in a screenshot or sample of the `instr.txt` too
1788,oh i included that in the post; its at the bottom
1788,Pycharm will undoubtedly start shouting at you haha
1788,"hahah; i see what you mean, was confused for a sec lol"
1788,Ok i see the file sample
1788,here's a post that goes a little more in depth as to my intent with an example source file <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/183187/crop-multiple-images-from-single-image/183222#183222>
1788,Have you tried it by just setting some default values here..
1788,yeah at the top
1788,"```major_columns = int(input(""Number of Pages: ""))
major_columns_w = int(input(""Width between cell to cell on the next page: ""))
major_rows = int(input(""Number of blocks per page: ""))
major_rows_h = int(input(""height between cell to cell on the next block: ""))
columns = int(input(""Number of columns inside a block: ""))
rows = int(input(""Number of rows inside a block: ""))
```"
1788,"ah that was the old code; at the bottom is the newer code, before I was taking user input, its quicker to read a file"
1788,"ok, besides taking any user input or reading in from a file, have you tried it with fixed values?"
1788,yeah once i tried setting all of them to none first at the top
1788,Ok and I'm guessing that didnt work
1788,"nope; would i still use the while loop after?; still getting the same issue it seems when i try this; ```lines = []

1789,Just trying to automate a work process
1788,I could maybe use python subprocess to `curl`?
1789,<@Corrinne> it's really not very interesting. most of my work lately has been helping universities get students into our library more easily
1788,<@Glinda> i mean...you could...but i'd probably spend my time figuring out why the other two are blocked. especially `requests`
1789,Well I hope you enjoy it at least. That's the important part
1788,"did all the logic look otherwise ok in my code? specifically the loop at the bottom? getting some funny results, math isnt my strong suit"
1788,"yeah, so far, so good; <@Fabian> honestly not sure what you were trying to accomplish so i just cut that part. explain, in english, what you're looking to do?"
1788,"ah ok give me one sec, its a little complex, or at least I think"
1789,<@Fabian> You definitely don't need to be a math genius to learn. Just try and break it down into logical steps
1788,"(that's why i said ""in english"" :smile: )"
1788,that makes sense
1789,Yeah English would help too :yum:
1788,gotta get out of that code mindset
1788,"<@Frieda> I know this is an open ended question, but what was the most effective way for you to learn Python / Development?"
1788,"uh. i built things; i mean, where do you want me to start? when i first learned any sort of ""coding""?; or learning python specifically?"
1788,Ok that was the answer I was hoping for / expecting
1788,or how i learn stuff now?
1789,Early days
1788,"Ok so have to use a little code, what im trying to determine, is what exactly this is doing, `y = h * row + start_y + major_rows_h * row_m` ive been trying to get the right measurements  using gimp,, and i believe im manipluating the height between the major rows here, and my estimates are way off, so im not sure if this is doing what i think it's doing"
1789,"Did you just pick a project, start building it and work everything out on the way?"
1788,"so, i'm old. i learned BASIC in elementary and middle school. then taught myself HTML on a computer that wasn't connected to the WWW (_HTML For Dummies_ shoutout) and i snuck floppy disks into the public library to upload my web site to GeoCities"
1789,"Haha, awesome"
1788,<@Fabian> you understand PEMDAS?
1788,Yeah its been a while but yes
1788,"<@Corrinne> was that a bit earlier than you wanted?; <@Fabian> parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction"
1788,No not at all. I find it interesting to known where everyone started their journey; Wish I had started earlier. But I'm only just creeping up to 30 :thinking_face:
1788,"<@Fabian> so that line multiplies `h` by `row` (I'll call that `x`), then `major_rows_h` by `row_m` (`z`). then it adds `x` to `start_y` and the sum of that to `z` . finally it assigns the sum of that to `y`; <@Corrinne> there's no max age on programming; one of the reasons i went to ORM was because i got interviewed by a recent hire who looked to be in their 50s"
1788,"The thing I realised shortly after starting to learn python / Web dev, is that you need to grasp a whole load of other technologies to put it to good use"
1788,web dev is one of the hardest disciplines because you have to understand so many moving parts
1788,I think I see
1788,"frameworks, servers, git, docker, aws, app engine etc.."
1788,each part is pretty simple but the cognitive load is no joke
1788,Yeah exactly
1788,ah ok i get it now; thank you again!
1788,<@Fabian> break it out into multiple steps if you need to
1788,It's all time and experience though
1788,code is cheap; obvious code &gt; clever code
1788,"True; DRY, KISS etc.. :sunglasses:"
1788,"if you were a clever as possible when you wrote the code, how will you ever debug it?"
1788,Yeh I learnt that quickly when I started out
1789,"But hey, sometimes you don't know certain gems are in the standard lib"
1788,"with python, at least, whatever you're wanting to do has probably already been done and put into stdlib; _always_ check the docs"
1788,"Yup, Python goes so deep!"
1788,i've been looking into learning Go lately and it's hard using a language that doesn't love you
1788,"For me, the biggest benefit has been just learning general programming principles; Ooh yeh I've watched a few vids on GO. Doesn't look friendly"
1788,"it's an interesting language, and definitely fast. but not friendly; i need to learn more Rust. that's a great community; and fun language"
1788,rust  is fun as shit; ive been doing a bunch of it lately
1788,i want the rust compiler for python
1788,there's such a thing? It would make my life so much easier if I could do the GUI to this emulator im making in python
1788,"no, there's not; i want it to exist, though"

1791,"Hi!
Can people here help on python back-end development?"
1791,"It’s best just to ask your question and if anyone can, they’ll chime in with an answer"
1791,Hi all i'm working on pyinstaller to make EXE from my django project. while running my EXE getting error like template doesn't exist. I hope someone can help me

1793,yeah and newer version of TLS are not available I believe; got trouble with the postgresql apt repo with ansible not too long ago due to python2.7
1793,Why did you change `ovv` to `Ovv`?
1793,Well names should start with a maj :smile:; and to differentiate with all my test accounts
1793,:thinking_face:
1793,"basicaly with all versions I'm getting this error; I have 2.7.13 , 2.6, 3.2, 3.5; I this it's something to do with lib"
1793,can you share the url ?; are you sure the certs is a valid one ?
1793,also when I try to pip upgrade I get `certificate: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate`; <@Ciera> url I'm using is in local network
1793,and if you `wget` it?
1793,"yep, it's same story"
1793,thats.. interesting
1793,`ERROR: The certificate of xxx is not trusted.`; `The certificate has expired `
1793,probably something with the openssl installed and the certificates
1793,well there you have it!
1793,ah well it's something else :smile:
1793,good old expiration
1793,but why then pip also shows ssl erros?
1793,proxy ?
1793,hmm...; not sure
1793,Try `pip -vvv [command]`; it's probably gonna spill a lot more details; if your network does something like mitm it's gonna be funny :|
1793,```Could not fetch URL <https://pypi.python.org/simple/pip/>: There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:661) - skipping```
1793,sadly not enough; `wget -d <https://pypi.python.org/simple/pip>`?
1793,`ERROR: The certificate of <http://pypi.python.org|pypi.python.org> is not trusted.`; `The certificate has expired`; strage
1793,sounds like there is something in between
1793,"yeah, their cert is scheduled to expire on 27 September 2018"
1793,Hm.. I will try to add certificate manually; so I figure out what was wrong; server date was `2018-12-20`
1793,:dizzy_face:
1793,kind'a stupid mistake
1794,Any way to revert a git command?. I just did a git rebase --abort and it rolled back a lot of my work. (i never ended a rebase that i started without noticing)
1794,you can use `git reflog` to find a commit to go back to I think
1794,Ok. Crossing my fingers here; yeah i fuckup; today's a sad day
1794,arg :confused:
1794,<@Mariano> if the changes were ever staged you might find them with `git fsck --lost-found`
1795,hello
1795,hi
1795,"Could someone to explain me, why we need to use `generators`, and for which reasons?"
1795,<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1twn9kLmYg> if you have 4 hours to spare :smile:
1795,"<@Ciera> thanks, for the video! but could you explain in two words, why need to use generatos? sometimes, I’m a little bit confused."
1795,"the goal are to win memory and sometime time; ```
for x in [1,2,3,4,5]:
  if x == 2:
    break
```; For example in this loop it will exit on the second item; so there isn't really a need to create a list with 5 item. If I have something that can give the item one by one I will win a bif of memory; ```
def give_items():
  result = []
  for x in range(10):
     time.sleep(2)
     results.append(x)
  return results

for x in give_items():
  if x == 2:
    break
```; In this case `give_items` will take a lot of time to return the full results; ```
def give_items():
  for y in range(10):
     time.sleep(2)
     yield y

for x in give_items():
  if x == 2:
    break
```; In this case it will be faster because once `give_items` yield 2 I can continue; does that make sense <@Bella> ?"
1795,<@Ciera> Yes! thanks for the explanation! and main goal of generatos it’s save time?
1795,mainly memory (I didn't really illustrate that here but imagine if the list is 1 million item long); it can save time but if you need to complete the loop if will take the same time
1795,"<@Ciera> Okay, got it! thanks;)"
1795,:thumbsup:; The video is really worth watching (as all :dabeaz: videos). Maybe not everything but just the beginning if you don't have the time
1795,"<@Ciera> Yeah, David Beazley discuss about generators and etc a lot:slightly_smiling_face:"
1796,What's the best way to run a separate python file as a subprocess?; When I use Popen its opening a python repl in my terminal that I launch the main script from...
1795,"the cleanest way would be to use the `multiprocessing` module, but then you don't launch a file; otherwise `subprocess.Popen()` with `python path/to/script.py`"
1796,"Well oddly enough when I run it on windows it runs as expected, however on linux it's opening the python repl in the terminal; subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, basepath+""/DeviceSocket.py""], shell=True)"
1796,what does your python script do? does it require input?
1796,"Currently have a Django list table view for books (w/ filters - book title, author, etc.). Books has a `foreign key` to comments, but comments has a `generic foreign key` to books (or anything else you could leave a comment on, like movies). 

*How could I go about having a free form text based search on a field pointed to a generic foreign key?* For instance, a text filter for searching (filtering) through the comment list view column."
1796,"Just needs to run the 'DeviceSocket' script as a subprocess, and continue on with the code block below the subprocess call in the main script; However when I run my main script in the terminal when it gets to the Popen line for that subprocess it opens a python repl in the terminal as if i had typed in ""python3""; This problem only occurs when I got from windows to linux; in windows it continues on with the code block below the subprocess.Popen"
1795,"hm, I like <@Ciera>'s approach. I personally use `subprocess.run()`."
1796,"Yeah unfortunately I'm restricted to using subprocess, the rest of the application is too tightly coupled to implement multithreading"
1795,<@Russ> what database are you using ? some db have full text search
1796,Could it be that I don't have the file marked as an executable on my linux setup?
1796,"no, you don't execute it anyway; you point Python to it"
1795,"does this works ? `python -c ""print('hello world')""`"
1796,as a subpocess
1796,"what is the call you are using, <@Elsie>? Can you show us some code?"
1796,"<@Ciera> I am utilizing MySQL, however, I am not sure how to have this Book list view be filtered by the comments - given that there is the generic foreign key from comments to Books."
1796,"Where basepath is the path in which my main script and ""DeviceSocket.py"" are located; <@Ciera> using Popen?"
1796,"yeah, my guess is it's not finding your script"
1796,it should throw an error and not enter the repl in that case
1796,hm okay
1796,well at least on my system it does.
1796,"And just to reiterate, it does not enter the repl on win7; python 3.4.3"
1796,are you 100% sure it's the same script ?
1796,100%
1795,"<@Russ> I'm not familliar with mysql, you might have better luck in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> or <#C3X4T24LB|databases> :slightly_smiling_face:"
1796,Copied everything over and tried running it
1796,"can you run this from the directory where the script lives? so something like `[sys.executable, 'DeviceSocket.py']`?"
1796,<@Winnifred> in the repl?
1797,"Hello, I'm working with the lxml library, and when debugging I never get to the third line of the following code:
```
if node.text is not None:
            if node.text &gt;= target:
                print('Test')
```
After checking that node.text is not None, and target being a string just like node.text, I still get a TypeError: NoneType object is not iterable."
1796,Scratch this. I just tested my hypothesis locally.
1795,Not sure what happens when you use `&gt;=` with two strings
1796,<@Winnifred> same behavior when run it in the repl
1796,are you sure it's what you want ? what do you want to check ?
1796,I want to make sure that the length of node.text is higher than the length of target.
1796,<@Elsie> do you get any output on `stderr` or `stdout` ?
1796,Or equal.
1796,you should use `len(my_string)` I believe
1796,<@Ciera> How should I check that?
1796,"That throws the same error. Also, pylint states that you may not use len as a conditional value."
1796,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 'aaa'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 'b'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a &gt; b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a &lt; b
True
```; I believe it's checking the numerical value of the letter and not the length of the string.; <@Elsie> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13398261/python-subprocess-call-and-subprocess-popen-stdout>. You might need to kill the process to make it finish if it hangs"
1796,<@Ciera> So the only way to go about this is using len(string)?
1796,"<@Elsie>, additionally, check out: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/43276598/3046539>"
1796,"Ok thanks, I'll check thoe out"
1796,"```
if node.text is not None:
            if len(node.text) &gt;= len(target):
                print('Test')
```
This throws the same error."
1796,"instead of `shell=True`, you can do `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and then poll to see if it is completed unless you need some output from subprocess."
1796,<@Ashlea> What is `target`?
1796,Target is an argument that the function expects. It's a string.
1796,you sure ? can you print it ?
1796,"Yes I can. And yes I am sure cause I'm running a unit test for this function, and I pass a string."
1797,Can you post the stack trace?

1796,"Well, the debugger in VS Code is kind of confusing, but for as far as I can tell that is not the case.; I'm actually looking for a noncommercial alternative to VS Code for Python, cause the IDE has issues with its Python extension."
1796,Something seems off because the snippet you posted definitely does not appear to contain any iteration and comparisons/len called on None types would have thrown different error
1796,"I thought the same.; Chances are the debugger is not clear enough, rather than that piece of code being incorrect?"
1796,Ok the problem is the function `getFirstRec` is not returning anything but you are splitting the return values which has an implicit iteration
1797,So none of your if/elif statements are evaluating to true for some reason
1796,So we're missing a return statement then.

1796,"what if you comment it out and just have `return False, ''`"
1796,"Oh it must be me being rusty. Have been away from coding for some time. Started recently again. What <@Ciera> pointed out, I fixed that, but I must've been running the test while you and I were talking without saving the changes. It no longer throws that error now.; Comparing my code now with the snippet I posted, the only change is that else block that was missing.; So the function indeed must've been returning nothing, since none of the if statements equated to True.; I'm new to Python, combine that with some rustiness and this happens. <@Ciera> <@Antionette> Thanks a lot for the help guys."

1798,"there's actually a lot of python underneath that
<https://wiki.python.org/moin/TupleSyntax>; like some things are optional, that commas create tuples, and tuple assignment"
1798,nice

Split the list into n equal parts where n = num of workers
Then submit each list to be worked on"
1798,"^^ same thing I was thinking; can you operate on each list in the ""master"" list?"
1798,What do you mean; I can access and take values then modify them and return a different list; then `del()` the old one to save memory
1798,"is your structure like `[ [ ],[ ],[ ] ]` ?"
1798,Yeah; BUT
1798,"if so, each process/thread can work on each list and modify them in place (I think)."
1798,"Technically it's not in that format; when I get it; Cause atm I basically run requests that pull a .csv from online and save into a list of lists where each internal list is a row in the .csv, however I do this ~9 times so I have a list of 9 lists with thousands of other lists within; So it's sort of setup already, however I don't want to just send those lists in cause one might be 5k items and another might be 500; I flatten the masterlist from `[ [ [ ], [ ] ], [ [ ], [ ] ] ]` -&gt; `[ [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ] ]`; But at that points its one main list of thousands of entries, and I need to split it up evenly so I may just do something like"
1798,pool knows which process so submit to
1798,You want to distribute work evenly? 
1798,`[master_list[len(master_list) / num_workers * n : (len(master_list) / num_workers * n+1) - 1] for i in range(num_workers-1))]`; If the syntax works that should be okay but there may be some quirks; I will do some quick test
1798,"I would go about it the same way. To get stuff done, I’d try without distributing work and then optimize like you’re doing. "
1798,Good point
1798,"I'd do
```
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as pool:
    futures = [pool.submit(worker, sublist) for sublist in yourlist]
    # Deal with completed futures, probably by using
    # concurrent.futures.as_completed
```"
1798,Even if more sublists than workers for now?
1798,"The executor maintains a job queue, why would you invent one outside of the pool by chunking the input?; Sure"
1798,Yeah you have a good point
1798,"I have an idea for a project I want to start, but every time I get a computer in front of me I don't know what to do. ; Any tips for jumping this mental barrier? "
1798,start small and iterate over it
1798,"```
for i in small.start():
```"
1798,Hah. I'm not even sure how to start with the design; I guess that doesn't matter. Cli.py can be refacotrd 
1798,I hope `small.start` is a generator <@Suellen>
1798,of course it is; we can make our own rules!
1798,"Now that I think about it, I'm kind of recreating cookiecutter; I want to have a template file, pass in a yaml file and template the vars from the yaml into a templated doc "
1798,<@Collette> I can either submit a list of items to be processed which can be a bit long OR I can submit a single job at a time via `executor.submit()`. Which would be more beneficial? Many smaller jobs OR few very large jobs in comparison
1799,bigger chunks -&gt; less overhead
1799,we want speed though :racing_car:
1799,:parrot_fast:; It's not gonna be more than ~200MB of data ever really; In this case
1799,"I like trying to scale ""horizontally"""
1799,"if you want speed with ProcessPoolExecutor: 
try to reduce the amount of data transmitted
Giving each worker a huge data structure and getting it back is generally not good
Giving a small piece of data so that each worker completes in about 0.1s is generally not good too"
1799,It really depends on what your worker function does
1799,"Sounds good. The worker function checks at a certain index in a list if it exists, then have some Regex that grabs a piece of it"
1799,And which pool you're using
1799,I'm basically converting lat and long in degrees minutes seconds to lat and long in decimal form; for a few thousand entries; I'm using processprool atm
1799,"<@Myong> if you'll chunk the data by cpu cores, don't forget about grouper recipe from <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html>"
1799,eli5: when would you guys use processpool vs. threadpool? what's the core difference?
1799,And try switching to ThreadPoolExecutor - it may reduce execution times significantly
1799,I think it's based on IO and CPU usage; Okay will do
1799,<@Collette> GIL though
1799,GIL only applies to bytecode execution
1799,What should i be using groupby for?
1799,doesn't kbman intend to compute stuff massively?
1799,"If you do lots of math via numpy or `math` (which are basically C), you may be avoiding GIL at all"
1799,"I'm, for the most part, only doing regex"
1799,:thinking_face: makes sense; oh
1799,But it's a pretty crazy regex token though it picks up everthing I need
1799,oh? lemme see that regex pattern I love me some regex; unless you already posted it
1799,"`[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d*(?:[eE][-+]?\d+)`; It catches all floats and integers"
1799,all your values have the `e` for exponent?
1799,No they do not I am gonna get rid of that
1799,yeeee
1799,It was just from stack overflow; no ngetatives either
1799,i threw it at <https://regexr.com/> it's my go to for easy tests
1799,"Pretty noob question here:
I'm going through a tutorial and got stuck at linking models because I keep getting FOREIGN KEY constraints failure.
How am I supposed to construct a foreign key in models?"
1799,"`[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d` this works"
1799,what about `1`; it wont pick it up
1799,o
1799,breaking regexes is clearly more interesting than fixing this bug i should be fixing
1799,Not sure where that one is messing up; It doesn't match any single digit number; no bueno
1799,lol append a `|(\d)`; the least elegant
1799,easy enough; Will that provide the same output; or does that create another group with `re.finall()`
1799,"oh it would def create another group; that was a solution, but not a good solution"
1799,no it works actually; gives me a single list
1799,"nice, i still think there's an elegant way to do that; what if you delete that last `\d`; i think that's what makes it require 2 numbers"
1799,Might have to go with original one :confused:
1799,"almost positive; `[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?` as opposed to `[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d`"
1799,Yeah the thing is that I need to catch decimals also; The original very first one does exactly what I need; and it's actually pretty quick; We shall see I appreciate the help
1799,"right on, for me that first one `[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d*(?:[eE][-+]?\d+)` seemed to require the `e` for exponent; `[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d*` this part seems fine though; i appreciate the distraction haha"
1800,"Hi everyone, I was wondering, is there a good place to find help for locust related scripts?"
1801,"what do you guys like for a minimal queuing system? I am not sure if we need the ""distributed"" nature of something like celery yet. But if its an easy setup it could be fine. I also saw RQ as well. I am going to try a minimal example setup for processing some work in python through a queue and using docker. we are trying to rewrite a portion of our stack from node."
1801,i used python-rq for a long time but after learning celery i probably would have just used celery.; the Python Cookbook has some really good examples too.; if you want something minimal.
1801,"ok cool. so celery is easy to get setup? ill have to check out the cookbook; does celery need redis? using docker, would it need to talk with a redis container for storage?"
1801,"I was curious about the function return type annotations. My Python book used them throughout but I almost never seen it in real code, is it some thing that is generally ignored?"
1801,celery needs some kind of broker.; you can use redis or rabbitmq.
1801,oh i was thinking rabbitmq was synonymous with celery
1801,"nope, it’s a broker. they are often used together so probably why you thought that."
1801,ah
1801,when you instantiate celery you pass the connection string to the broker.
1801,"hmm. in node theres a library called `kue` which is nice since we just import it, and it talks to redis directly to handle the queue.; ah ok."
1801,this is my celery config. some of the tasks are loading the database with data as others are computing student mastery of topics and other things. <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/celery.py>; aside from that you add a task decorator to whatever functions you want to execute async and that’s about it.; oh and you have to make sure to run your celery workers process and then run your celery beat process; if you want to use celery-beat
1801,"when using the decorator, it puts the funtion into the queue based on when it does I/O ?; or just when the function is called"
1801,"the latter, wherever you decide to use it in code you will have `.delay()` method.; my_async_function.delay()"
1801,"oh wait, with the config. i think i see. so the config is basically scheduling these ""loaders"" to run at given intervals?"
1801,"yep, that part is using celery-beat."
1801,ah ok.
1801,if you’re not running anything on a schedule you can ignore all that.
1801,ok. so thats more like running it as a cron setup?
1801,"yea, you can use cron syntax or some others iirc."
1801,"well, thats interesting. part of this is running on a cron like setup. but that, is processing some data and when work needs to be done, we want to send that to another queue so workers can process it.; currently this is all in one shitty service and managed through a Thread.js file and is messy. so were going to rebuild it and looking at using node or python. im pushing for python."
1801,sounds like it would be achievable in celery.
1801,"so the ""thread"" is run and looks to see if anything needs to be processed. if it does, it preps it, then starts up to 10 threads to do the work.; those threads doing the work, we just want as workers to monitor a queue to see when work needs to be done."
1801,"yea, that’s why we have the different queues. you can create different ones for different workers.. you can add priority and other things."
1801,ok cool. so why did you switch from RQ to celery?
1801,we use celery in a lot of our other apps so it was to remain consistent.; i was the outlier using RQ.
1801,ah. are there benefits to using RQ?
1801,it’s “simpler”.
1801,would it do what I need in your opinion based on what I described?
1801,celery is often touted as having a large learning curve. that’s why i avoided it. but after working with it it isn’t all that bad.
1801,ok
1801,"yea, i don’t see why not. you may need to do a quick spike to see what you like best."
1801,"yea.; so how is celery ""distributed"" ? looking at their page.; so you can have multiple instances replicating each others queues?; mostly, the threads that run and to the processes are long running and take time."
1801,the workers are distributing the work and you can distribute the workers among any number of machines. they all know how to talk to each other b/c of the broker.
1801,a larger process takes about 10 minutes. some times more. it takes about 10 hours to run them for all clients. and its done daily; ah ok. you cant do that with RQ?; or as easily?
1801,not sure really. i haven’t used RQ to that capacity but i would assume so b/c all the workers need is a copy of the source code they can access.; the same goes for celery
1801,yea. that was my thought; i just spin up workers based on need or load. and they have thecode. and just look to see what work needs to be done.
1801,as long as they can all talk to the same broker it should work.
1801,what about failover. if the queue container breaks or fails. how is that handled?; ok.
1801,you get a bunch of rabbitmq errors.
1801,"ah, or i suppose what if the broker fails.; ok.; we want to prevent lost jobs; well, we have to"
1801,you can have celery retry a task a number of times.; if it keeps failing you can setup a dead-mailbox or something like that.; you can also have celery send an email.
1801,"well, i mean if celery goes down. or, in this case, redis since its the backend store; hmm; i suppose if it goes down, we can re-run the main worker to rebuild the queue."
1801,o wait n/m dead-letter queue is rabbitmq specific.
1801,its a finite amount of work (that would get larger as we get more users) but its that they are long running.
1801,"i got you. celery has what are known as signatures, chains, and groups, you can use these to execute your tasks in particular ways.; a chain for example will execute tasks in order and only when the first one completes."
1801,ok. thats nice.
1801,for monitoring: <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/monitoring.html>; flower is pretty sweet.
1801,but what im thinking about. is the storage of the queue. in redis. what if redis goes down. For this case i would assume that the redis data has to be persisted onto a data volume or s3? or something. so if it goes down it can be restarted and get the data back. or we could possibly re-build the queue; ok ill check it out thanks.
1801,"yea, you would need to run a persistent redis."
1801,i just havent done this much yet for deploying all this.; would it save data to s3 or just a mounted volume or something?
1801,i think redis has its own thing
1801,were not using docker yet. well we are but only for a small service. im onw of the few that is trying to help and bring docker in by getting small things running in it.; ok.
1801,yea it’s called RDB. <https://redis.io/topics/persistence>
1801,ok. basically we cant afford to lose data.
1801,"yea, says the RDB can be stored on amazon s3"
1801,"this is all done every day. so backup would only need to be done for the current or last day.; main thing, is if it fails for whatever reason. when we bring it up we want to continue from where we left off.; &gt; RDB is NOT good if you need to minimize the chance of data loss in case Redis stops working (for example after a power outage); what we store in redis shouldnt be too large.; ok, i think the AoF part is more what im looking for."
1801,is the current thing not working well?
1801,"but, it may not be too big of a deal. the list of all work can be built in a couple minutes probably. so if redis goes down. we can probably just rebuild it.; it is working, but its really messy. its basically a small monolith.; its all done in 1 big thread managed in code. and spawns process threads (up to 10) to actually process the work. and its hard to debug. and right now, im debugging a race condition.; so when we have clients thats using this to monitor $1b worth of work reports, we want ti to be stable and easy to work on."
1802,I have a module with a `def main():` block i’m trying to call this module from another file using the context trick (<https://github.com/kennethreitz/samplemod/blob/master/tests/context.py>) in my tests folder i’m trying to say module.main() and it’s telling me it’s not callable. any pointers?

1811,No; Max length of a variable name; Is there any restriction?

1811,I read that there is no restriction and it can be any reasonable length

1816,I'm trying to get data from the wunderground api. I'm able to get it using requests. when i print it out after I load it I'm having trouble retrieving specific keys I want to get.
1816,are you loading the json response into a dict?
1816,I believe so I can call current_observation and it pulls all the pairs under that; but I don't know how to call the nested ones
1816,"you have a couple options; execute the api request in a rest client like postman, then inspect the response; or two, implement a recursive dict traversal to print out the keys in the dict; I’d go for the first"

1816,"her eyou go; <https://www.getpostman.com/>; you have a request url you use to query the api; enter that in postman,; and you’ll see the data response"
1817,"<@Devorah> if you're up for learning, the reading of the errors and parsing a bunch of dicts within a list within a dict is a great way to practice indexing and key/value iteration and searching, on the other hand, this has been solved long ago and if it doesn't interest you, can you skip for now or forever"
1818,"Hi.  I am brand new to this group, so I hope I am not making any mistakes.  I am not a heavy programmer, but I am trying to help my father with an issue.  He is working on a camera built with a Raspberry Pi and Python for taking picture of a retina. The problem is that the code he has always saves the picture with the same name.  Thus, if you take a picture, it writes over the previous picture.  It should instead save each picture with a new name.  Also, at the end the script shuts down the camera, rather than letting you take multiple pictures without restarting the program.  Below is the code.  How can I change it to fix these problems?  If I should post this somewhere else, please let me know.  Thanks.

1817,"<@Marco> welcome, if you are going to paste a lot of code, please click the plus on the side of the text bar and input the code there.  The `with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:` block is written to close down the `with` block when the process is complete, you could use a `while True:` block to keep the program alive though that is rough as it does not have a condition for closure."
1817,"<@Marco> Because the script is already importing `time`, you could just follow same convention that most other camera software use: timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.

Change line
`camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image1.jpg', use_video_port=True)`
To something like
```
datetime_captured = time.strftime(""%Y%m%d%H%M%S"")
camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/' + datetime_captured + '.jpg', use_video_port=True)
```
The above will produce file w/ name like `20171223140944.jpg` in `/home/pi/Desktop/`.

As for having software run until explicitly exiting, something along the lines of what <@Seema> suggested is way to go."

1829,i have no clue; this is in fact a first
1829,"it's very strange to have a `""null""` instead of `null`"
1829,"ok, that’s werd"
1829,I see this
1829,probably because the value is a string and not `None`
1829,"i know, thats why id like to convert it to `null`"
1829,"in the dict, if you do `dict_variable['secondEmail']`, is it a string or `None`?; because if its a string, then that’s your issue.  you should use `None` instead"
1829,let me check; its a string
1829,"that’s why; so if you want `null` to be output in the json serialization, you should have that value be `None`"
1829,"OHHH; <@Meg> thats why; That makes sense,; thanks a lot"
1829,welcome :slightly_smiling_face:
1830,Also I couldn't able to understand the method any in tuple
1830,"Python 3 does not allow that either - there are two issues - one you are trying to assign to an integer literal, and two variables cannot begin with numbers; I don’t know what the environment is that seemed to allow it, but it’s incorrect behavior to allow it"
1830,Hi jkelly; I am trying it from a python 3.6 in a website; It works there and it's not working in 2.7
1830,"I would stop using this website then, it’s not using a true python interpreter; what website is it?"
1830,Python <http://tutor.com|tutor.com>; I got your point regarding variable rule
1830,yeah perhaps they are doing something weird with the variables before passing them to an underlying interpreter.
1830,Do you know about python any method; I'm scartaching my head to understand it
1830,"yes, essentially it ensures that at least one value in an iterable evaluates to `True`; a related method is `all`, which assures that all values evaluate to `True`"
1830,"Yeah. Read it but in the example; The output is 
True false true false; I'm wondering how"
1830,"it’s basically the same as a function that is like this:

```
def any(iter):
    for item in iter:
        if item:
            return True
    return False
```"
1830,It would be nice if you can explain me the output of above code
1830,"the reason is python has a concept of “truthiness” - essentially values like 0, None and False all are roughly equivalent in boolean comparison"
1830,Like how it was true or false
1830,"and non-zero integers, non-empty strings, etc. and of course True are all True"
1830,But in case 1 and 3 0 is there and still return true ?; Because we need atleast one true ?; Am I right ?
1830,"exactly; if *any* value is true, then it returns true"
1830,Got it mate :grin: ; Thanks for explaining
1830,"No problem; at least for me, it’s not something I use often, except when writing tests"
1830,Hehe I have been learning Python so making notes of these methods with examples:wink: 
1830,that’s always a good idea.  are you by chance going through the list here? <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html>
1830,No mate; There is a site called <http://programiz.com|programiz.com> which is containing all most all methods for string tuple set dictionary list in a plain and simple manner

1832,hahaha yes i've gotten a lot of use out of those regex builders :slightly_smiling_face:
1832,So your problem; there's a cerrtain word you want that is case insensitive; if you find such pattern  `.....{pattern}...`; you want to replace with; `.....&lt;b&gt;{pattern}&lt;/b&gt;...`
1832,right; but I don't want to replace {pattern}; which is what my code does right now
1832,"regex is fine; if you want an easy way; ```def string_match(input, compare):
    lower_case = input.lower()
    compare_lower = compare.lower()```; First conver to lowercase for both; Then use string methods to find all matches.; Use the found location indices"
1832,right I was thinking that...; would regex be cleaner though?
1832,"Now you might ask, well isn't it slow to remake a string?; It really depends; So if you know of that solution. Let's work on the regex one.; ```content = ""Test tEst TEsT""

'images/&lt;span&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt;/huge'```"
1832,ahhhh; yes that's what I am looking for :slightly_smiling_face:

1832,"hmm; so that creates a group test_word which contains every case-insensitive instance of ""test""?"
1832,"Lastly here is another way that might be helpful; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/16720705>; using `(?P&lt;name&gt;pattern)` creates a named group where you can reference with `name` and searches for the word `pattern`; Another thing that's helpful; is regex matches in python are objects; which contain some useful attributes; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects>; specifically ```&gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match(r""(?P&lt;first_name&gt;\w+) (?P&lt;last_name&gt;\w+)"", ""Malcolm Reynolds"")

So im searching a way to call a function inside build.py file, like ""do_build(param)"" that i can pass everything that i need as a dictionary.

`--rm` removes the container when it stops/exits. My guess is that any mapped volumes disappear as well. Do you have this issue if you DON'T use `--rm`?"
1866,if it's working :thumbsup:; but it looks a bit scary :smile:
1866,Yeah I figure when I properly make it into a module the `__name__` part will look better.
1867,"I need help. I've read so many posts/responses/articles... even watched 2 hrs worth of vids on LinuxAcademy on Git that things like <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing> may as well be written as hieroglyphs.
What I need to do is replace my local repo w/ the most recent upstream. So sync my local copy so that it is exactly as the latest upstream/master copy.
fetch, rebase, pull, merge, sorcery, it all just produces errors. 
```

1866,do you have local changes you need to keep ?
1866,no.
1866,"ok, do `git stash`; and then `git pull`; assuming you’re on the master branch, or whatever branch you need to be on"
1866,"and i've thought about deleting my local copy but....
stash?"
1866,or nuke the directory and clone again (but you won't learn anything)
1866,"<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash>; &gt;Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit."

but this leaves a `This branch is 3 commits ahead of pyslackers:master.` on GitHub.; thanks for `git stash` <@Meg>; Or am I just supposed to ignore that?"
1866,no that's because you have some merge commit in your master that aren't on pyslackers; I'm not sure what's the easiest way to fix that :thinking_face:; Link for those interested <https://github.com/khdc-me/website/commits/master>

1866,j/k
1866,ok so `git checkout master` (just to be sure); then `git fetch upstream` (just to be sure bis); `git reset --hard upstream/master` to clear your master and use the upstream (pyslackers) one; `git push origin master --force` to push your local master to your fork

oh oh oh oh `This branch is even with pyslackers:master.`; <@Ciera> :taco:"
1866,thanks :thumbsup:; good work on the website :wink:
1866,no man. thank you!
1866,you learn somthing every day; and git (or whatever VCS) is one of those things you do need to be comfortable with especially if you’re on a team
1866,take care to create a new branch before doing any modifications
1866,"yeah. I've been after this for a couple of days. tried reset, just hadn't used `--hard`. anyway, you guys are awesome."
1868,Does anyone know of a good project structure for a sanic application?; I'm thinking about doing a straight copy of whatever flask would do.
1866,Today I will try. Thanks. 
1868,"New question, how does everyone here use pytest for REST apis?

I ask because I have things such as test_update_user that needs me to

- Setup a test user in the database via `post(/api/user, data=new_user_data)`
- Perform test on user update via `put(/api/user/&lt;username&gt;, data=updated_user_data) `
- Teardown the test user via `delete(/api/user/&lt;username&gt;)`

I don't really know how to consolidate the Setup and Teardown aspects of this into a fixture."
1869,this might be overkill and I honestly haven't used it but I heard about this on pybyes podcast <https://taverntesting.github.io/>; <https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/52/call-your-apis-with-uplink-and-test-them-in-the-tavern>
1870,"Hello. I'm new to python and am a bit puzzled about using virtualenv and was wondering what the current best practices are surrounding that, especially for beginners"
1870,"<@Sherley> I'm being a *bit* simplistic but the norm is virtualenv for everything.  If you use more than one version of Python, it becomes very handy, especially when you start using the switches/options."
1870,<@Seema> has virtualenv been phased out in favor of docker?
1870,"<@Sherley> I'd say start with `pipenv`. It has its quirks, but for an end-user it works better than just plain virtualenv"
1870,Or is it still accepted to use virtualenv
1870,docker is a whole different story
1870,"Depending on your philosophy and desires, you can use both together or just a virtualenv.  They are not the same though can accomplish similar tasks"
1870,"From what I understand, the point of virtualenv is to keep each project and its dependencies isolated; Which incidentally also coincides with my understanding of docker's purpose.. Or at least its central one"
1870,"Docker creates composable environments while virtualenv creates a virtual environment, installing to a virtualenv is isolated from the system but available after deactivation.  Docker images are created, calling the same image next time will create the original environment; There are other advantages and disadvantages.  Are you developing for yourself?; The pros often come down to how you want to manage dependencies, system files, and whether you are sharing the environment.  Virtualenv really does take care of the majority of the issues in a simpler fashion; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe>"
1870,<@Seema> The project that I was interested in is an open source project I found on GitHub
1870,"The project will typically have a lead either by including a docker file or a requirements. Txt or possibly even both; I would follow the project in that case, ymmv"
1870,"Ok. It recommends virtualenv but is missing explicit directions on how to use it in the readme, <http://GitHub.com/hackforla/adopt-civic-art|GitHub.com/hackforla/adopt-civic-art>"
1870,"Like Malinoff said, you can use other virtualenv, either way, you'll create an environment, clone the repo, then pip install -r requirements.txt; The command will change depending on the program of course; (Off for the night, gn, good luck)"
1870,Thanks
