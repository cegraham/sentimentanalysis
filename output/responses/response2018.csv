I recommend using `findall` as little as possible.; go for either `re.search` to search the entire message or `re.match` for the first instance of your returned search; the `re.findall('.*', message)` message returns everything b/c that's what you're expressing with `*`""

Basically, `r` allows you to not have to escape a real backslash with a second backslash, and you always escape real backslashes with a second backslash in a regular expression, so `r` isn't applicable.""

Maybe you could try using `schemas`? <@Davina> has a great demo repo showing how to use with `Flask`: <https://github.com/mikefromit/flask-jsonschema-example>; What JSON schema is: <https://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/about.html>; Of course, it is possible that I've read your issue wrong and maybe you'd benefit from a different approach. :simple_smile:; Basically you'd write a decorator function that checks the input submitted to see if it matches certain parameters, meaning you could do without all the `if` statements in the main body of your route and move straight to processing your data.; As an example here's my code for a `schema`: <https://github.com/leni1/WeConnect-Api/blob/feature-flask-api-non-persistent/app/schemas/business_schema.py> and the validator decorator: <https://github.com/leni1/WeConnect-Api/blob/feature-flask-api-non-persistent/app/v1/validator.py>.

"
1938,"3588,1540846969.3282,Galen,""Your issue is several steps 'up' from requests. The error happens before you pass that data to it; Your `get_users` function attempts to add a bunch of stuff together, and passes that to `request_endpoint`, which in turn passes it to `requests.get`. But the error is telling you that the problem is on the line where you add all the stuff together. Something there is the wrong type; Note that you can't just use the `+` operator to group things up. It performs a specific operation depending on the type - it adds numbers, concatenates strings, etc. But if you try and use it on different types, it can give errors; The examples where multiple types are being passed to requests, is presumably by creating a dict of the items and passing that as `params`; I would also advise you that your `request_endpoint` function looks a bit odd. It seems to be assigning to a variable that is the same name as the function. That is something I used to see a lot in the Visual Basic days but I don't know exactly what it would do in this case. You probably just intended to return the result instead, i.e. `return requests.get(etc....).json()`""
