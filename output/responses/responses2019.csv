The most common use case is implementing natural language processing (NLP) to an utterance/text message to identify a discrete “intent” e.g. “Hey Siri, what’s the time?” may map to an intent called “lookup-time”. These intents are effectively conversational states, and you can design and control the flow of conversation programmatically by managing these states. I recommend trying out Google’s Dialogflow (<https://dialogflow.com/>) in order to get a better understanding. The good thing about Dialogflow is that the machine learning model is provided for you so that you can just focus on designing the conversational flow.
