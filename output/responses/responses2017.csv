887,"""OK, I've been working on something and can't seem to get all the pieces together correctly.  The goal: Take a list of list of strings (results of a query from a SQL database), (hopefully) compress it, and ship it to an Azure blob storage as .tsv files.  All in memory.  The azure-storage library has a create_blob_from_stream option which I've successfully used to send a `io.BytesIO` stream (without compressing) and it works as intended, although I think it could be cleaned up.  Ultimately, I'm not sure I'm fully understanding the various pieces of the `io` standard library and want to get some suggestions on how to improve things.  I can't seem to get the compression working (tried zipfile and gzip) and I run into issue where I'll open(..., 'w') the GzipFile/ZipFile, write contents to it, but then can't send it to blob because it doesn't have read access (because I opened it with write to add to the compressed file?); Trying to keep it as lightweight as possible since it's going to be running on an RPi (hence the trying to avoid writing to disk aspect); The compression might be optional if the overhead of compressing isn't worth doing it (to lower the bandwidth), I was going to test doing it with/without and see if it was worth the tradeoff in time spent sending it to blob uncompressed vs compressed).  I can't imagine the overhead is a lot but I honestly have no clue and I'm trying to not prematurely optimize before needed.  Would love thoughts from anyone who's more familiar with this stuff""

Maybe I need to do something like open a stream `f`, with `gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, 'w')` add the relevant row elements to that Gzip, which maybe puts that compressed stuff into the stream f?; Right now I think I'm adding things to the stream, then somehow trying to zip it up after the fact; Ahahaha, that was it!; Something just clicked about streams""

(but as your project gets bigger, i think you'll discover that actually hey a lot of those things are going to be needed, and you'll end up needing to research and integrate a solution in flask). but, you spend a month building up a flask app vs a django app, and while you'd probably get further on the django app, you're also going to have a much deeper understanding of how flask works compared to the """"magic"""" of django""
