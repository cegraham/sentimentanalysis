But the error is telling you that the problem is on the line where you add all the stuff together. Something there is the wrong type; Note that you can't just use the `+` operator to group things up. It performs a specific operation depending on the type - it adds numbers, concatenates strings, etc. But if you try and use it on different types, it can give errors; The examples where multiple types are being passed to requests, is presumably by creating a dict of the items and passing that as `params`; I would also advise you that your `request_endpoint` function looks a bit odd. It seems to be assigning to a variable that is the same name as the function. That is something I used to see a lot in the Visual Basic days but I don't know exactly what it would do in this case.
